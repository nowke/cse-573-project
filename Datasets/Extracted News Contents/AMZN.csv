2021-04-02 02:27:33,"amazon.com inc. (nasdaq: amzn) was reportedly exploring the possibility of opening a chain of brick-and-mortar retail stores to sell its unsold inventory at discounted prices in early 2020, but shelved the idea when the covid-19 pandemic took root.  the abandoned plans: according to a bloomberg report citing “two people familiar with the plans,” the e-commerce giant was considering a variety of options ranging from permanent retail locations to pop-up stores in malls and parking lots.  “it’s a way to be able to clean out warehouses, and get through inventory without having to destroy it,” said one of the unnamed people sourced for the report. “it is keeping with the value proposition of amazon, keeping price at the forefront and allowing customers to get access to products at low cost.”  amazon is not a stranger to brick-and-mortar retail: it first opened a bookstore chain in 2015 and later opened the cashier-less convenience store amazon go; the electronics and home goods store, amazon 4-star; and the amazon fresh grocery chain. the company currently operates 96 brick-and-mortar stores and seven mall pop-up stores under its brand and more than 500 whole foods market supermarkets.  related link: target to open apple mini-shops in its stores  a potential partnership: while the new report claimed the company turned its attention away from new brick-and-mortar operations because of the impact of the pandemic on traditional retailing, amazon had been approached during the middle of the pandemic to consider converting unused retail space into distribution hub warehouses.  last august, the wall street journal cited anonymous “people familiar with the matter” in reporting amazon was in talks with simon property group inc. (nyse: spg) to take over anchor department stores that became empty when major retailers including jcpenney (owned by simon) and sears holding corp. (otc: shldq) began to shut down their operations. at the time the article was published, the simon malls had 63 penney and 11 sears stores, with both companies winding down their retail presence after respective bankruptcy filings.  the article stated it was uncertain how many stores were being considered for amazon, which ultimately decided not to pursue the partnership.  related link: will target's new private-label grocery brand be a hit?

""this is a long-standing, industry-wide issue and is not specific to amazon,"" the company said.  why it matters: the march 24 tweet was met with quick criticism, and the apology isn't faring much better. the verge criticized it as ungenuine, noting that the apology is to the congressman, not workers, and for claiming the issue only concerns drivers.  amazon for years has faced accusations that workers are under so much pressure that they forgo bathroom breaks. the complaints have included both warehouse workers and drivers.  the company also is in the middle of a union battle, featuring what could be a landmark vote that has implications not just for amazon locations, but other tech companies in the u.s. as well. amazon's twitter activity on this front also has drawn heat.  photo: flickr/tony webster"
2021-04-03 16:27:24,"amazon has issued a rare public apology — but not to its workers, and with no real admission of guilt.  over a week ago, the company was caught publicly lying to rep. mark pocan (d-wi) that its workers never feel the need to pee in water bottles (which is, in fact, a well-documented issue at amazon because of how it robotically tracks and fires its laborers).  now, late on the friday evening before easter weekend, when few (hat tip to geekwire) are paying attention, the company is apologizing to pocan — and no one else. amazon only apologizes for not being “accurate” enough, too — not for actually creating and contributing to situations where workers pee in bottles.  the @amazonnews account didn’t bother to tweet any of this, btw  in fact, amazon goes so far as to suggest the whole pee bottle thing is simply a regrettable status quo, pointing out a handful of times when other companies’ delivery drivers were also caught peeing in bottles, as well as embedding a handful of random comments on twitter that happen to support amazon’s views. you can almost hear jeff bezos saying “why aren’t these people blaming ups and fedex? let’s get more people thinking about them instead.”  the blog post also strongly suggests that this is only an issue for delivery drivers, not amazon’s warehouse workers — even though a 2018 expose from an undercover reporter found amazon warehouse workers were also forced to skip bathroom breaks, and a worker who spoke to journalists just last week suggested bathroom breaks were still an issue in 2021. “you’re sitting there and you have to go take a piss, but you don’t want to rack up ‘time off task,’” she told motherboard.  amazon is currently facing a lawsuit over missed lunch breaks as well. and most importantly, all of this is happening in the shadow of an amazon union vote in bessemer, alabama that could help shape the future of labor in the united states, let alone at amazon.  amazon’s apology to pocan is the kind of memo that deserves to be annotated, line-by-line, partially because one of its lines is actually fairly good — “regardless of the fact that this is industry-wide, we would like to solve it. we don’t yet know how, but will look for solutions” — but because it’s past 1am here and it turns out the verge’s blockquote tool doesn’t let me embed tweets, i’ll just give you the primary guts for now:  on wednesday last week, the @amazonnews twitter account tweeted the following back to representative mark pocan: this was an own-goal, we’re unhappy about it, and we owe an apology to representative pocan. first, the tweet was incorrect. it did not contemplate our large driver population and instead wrongly focused only on our fulfillment centers. a typical amazon fulfillment center has dozens of restrooms, and employees are able to step away from their work station at any time. if any employee in a fulfillment center has a different experience, we encourage them to speak to their manager and we’ll work to fix it. second, our process was flawed. the tweet did not receive proper scrutiny. we need to hold ourselves to an extremely high accuracy bar at all times, and that is especially so when we are criticizing the comments of others. third, we know that drivers can and do have trouble finding restrooms because of traffic or sometimes rural routes, and this has been especially the case during covid when many public restrooms have been closed. this is a long-standing, industry-wide issue and is not specific to amazon. we’ve included just a few links below that discuss the issue. regardless of the fact that this is industry-wide, we would like to solve it. we don’t yet know how, but will look for solutions. we will continue to speak out when misrepresented, but we will also work hard to always be accurate. we apologize to representative pocan.  you can read the full version here. when you’re finished, perhaps check out motherboard’s interview with six female amazon delivery drivers, for whom the pee situation is obviously much worse."

2021-04-04 16:31:22,"new york (cnn business) for more than two decades, amazon has bulldozed over bricks-and-mortar businesses, hired and churned through vast numbers of workers and even pitted cities against each other to bid for its second headquarters, all in service to its seemingly bottomless thirst for growth and satisfying customers. its dominance was only further cemented in the last year by the pandemic, as households across the country leaned on the company for deliveries.  but if the company's recent public statements are any indication, a small town in alabama now has the tech giant on edge.  in the last week-and-a-half, as a milestone union election at an amazon warehouse in bessemer, alabama, came to a close, the company openly antagonized lawmakers and some behind the union effort.  executive dave clark swiped at bernie sanders ahead of a rally the senator was joining with some organizing workers in alabama last month. ""i often say we are the bernie sanders of employers, but that's not quite right because we actually deliver a progressive workplace,"" he said on twitter. clark also emphasized amazon's $15 hourly minimum wage -- a policy only introduced after sanders and others pressured the company in 2018.  after rep. mark pocan of wisconsin pointed out that the hourly pay ""doesn't make you a 'progressive workplace' when you union-bust & make workers urinate in water bottles,"" the company effectively kickstarted an entire news cycle with its response from a verified corporate twitter account: ""you don't really believe the peeing in bottles thing, do you?"" publications posted stories about amazon drivers urinating in bottles and defecating in bags on the job. amazon issued a blog post more than a week later regarding the tweet.the post, published late friday, said the tweet was ""an own-goal, we're unhappy about it, and we owe an apology to representative pocan."" furthermore, it said while the tweet was incorrect, the issue is ""not specific to amazon"" and blamed a ""flawed"" process in reviewing the tweet. ""we need to hold ourselves to an extremely high accuracy bar at all times, and that is especially so when we are criticizing the comments of others,"" the post said.  for his part, rep. pocan replied via tweet: ""sigh. this is not about me, this is about your workers.""  and in response to a recent cnn business story about what comes next in the bessemer effort once the final results of the union vote are announced, amazon responded with a statement calling the president of the union mobilizing the warehouse workers the ""chief disinformation officer."" in a later, separate statement, the company hit at the union, by citing declining membership as the impetus driving the union president to ""misrepresent the facts.""  when asked for comment, amazon spokesperson heather knox largely deferred to the blog post. additionally, knox said in a statement that the company doesn't believe the union ""represents the majority of our employees' views.""  ""our employees choose to work at amazon because we offer some of the best jobs available everywhere we hire, and we encourage anyone to compare our total compensation package, health benefits, and workplace environment to any other company with similar jobs,"" the statement continued.  the company's confrontational approach to public relations in recent days has surprised industry watchers, labor experts and some current and former employees. amazon employees for climate justice, a group of corporate employees that originally formed to advocate on climate issues, told cnn business in a statement that they are ""ashamed to see the aggressive tactics amazon's twitter account has taken recently.""  ""while workers are fighting for basic and important issues like workplace safety, amazon is focused on its fear of its own workers and lashing out at politicians. amazon is afraid because it knows that workers have power when we speak up together,"" the statement read.  faisal masud, who worked at amazon in the 2000s and helped to launch its warehouse deals program and its amazonbasics product line, said he ""found it a little unusual frankly, our pr posture was always very reserved, it wasn't to show off but to watch from the sidelines."" masud, who now helps brands compete with amazon as ceo of ecommerce startup fabric, said amazon is ""so large now, maybe they've taken a different approach on how to tackle some of these challenges.""  some industry watchers see in amazon's recent pr posture proof that the technology giant may be feeling newly vulnerable, given the potential for a fundamental upending of how it engages with its hundreds of thousands of us workers.  ""the very pettiness of the attack against bernie sanders, and the comments made about workers, make the company look like it is very worried. it doesn't mean that amazon is going to lose, but it does make it look like they're worried they're going to lose,"" said kate bronfenbrenner, director of labor education research and a senior lecturer at cornell university's school of industrial and labor relations.  likewise, daniel hanley, a reporter-policy analyst with the open markets institute, an advocacy group critical of big tech's influence and power, said amazon ""fears having a union because it knows it will lose the ability to exploit workers and that its operations will have checks and balances by the people who endure its decisions -- as it should be.""  (in a statement to cnn business, amazon's knox said: ""the fact is that amazon already offers what unions are requesting for employees: industry-leading pay, comprehensive benefits from the first day on the job, opportunities for career growth, all while working in a safe, modern work environment."")  but it's also easy to interpret the actions differently, especially considering how admired amazon is as a company and how well its business is performing. as american economic liberties project's matthew stoller put it recently, amazon may be acting like ""public jerks on twitter"" because the company is ""confident they will win the union election.""  according to the news outlet vox , the combative approach to critics was directed by amazon founder and outgoing ceo jeff bezos, who was reportedly displeased that there wasn't more pushback to public criticisms of the company.  bronfenbrenner said she expects there has been some frustration at amazon that touting policies like its $15 minimum wage hasn't been enough to convince workers and critics to lay off. masud also said he wonders whether the public pushback may come from a feeling that the company is being held to a different standard than competitors, such as walmart and target. (target boosted its minimum wage to $15 in 2020, while walmart recently bumped its average -- not minimum -- pay to $15.25 an hour; both have been notoriously anti-union.)  whatever its motivation may be, amazon's latest pr approach risks upsetting federal and local politicians at a time when it may need political goodwill. like other big tech companies, amazon faces scrutiny for alleged anti-competitive conduct and monopoly power -- and its growing dominance during the pandemic may only increase that scrutiny, according to dr. mary-hunter mcdonnell, professor of management at university of pennsylvania's wharton school of business.  at the same time, by vocally opposing a union push that has garnered national attention, amazon risks not only turning off some of its workers but also local politicians -- a group it may need if it wants to seek subsidies to build warehouses and offices in the future.  ""the labor play they are engaging in is a really poor, myopic strategy because as soon as you signal you're not going to support the people who work for your company locally, it has the threat of turning local policymakers against you as well,"" mcdonnell said."

2021-04-05 13:35:15,"the national labor relations board (nlrb) has found amazon illegally retaliated against two of its most outspoken internal critics when it fired them last year.  last april, amazon fired emily cunningham and maren costa, two former user experience designers, for ""repeatedly violating internal policies."" cunningham and costa argued they were fired in retaliation for their continued criticism of amazon.  the nlrb confirmed to cnbc that it found merit to cunningham and costa's unfair labor practice complaint, which was filed last october. if amazon doesn't agree to settle the case, the agency said it would file a complaint against amazon in the next few weeks and set a trial date in the coming months. news of the nlrb's decision was first reported by the new york times.  in a statement, amazon spokesperson jose negrete said the company disagrees with the nlrb's decision.  ""we support every employee's right to criticize their employer's working conditions, but that does not come with blanket immunity against our internal policies, all of which are lawful,"" negrete said. ""we terminated these employees not for the reasons cited in the preliminary finding, but because they repeatedly violated internal policies.""  costa and cunningham were members of the employee advocacy group amazon employees for climate justice, which has called on amazon to develop a comprehensive climate change plan, among other environmental initiatives.  during the coronavirus pandemic, costa and cunningham raised concerns about the company's treatment of warehouse workers and a lack of safety measures for front-line employees.  they also participated in a series of actions to pressure amazon to change how it responds to workers who speak out against its policies. last january, aecj organized hundreds of employees to intentionally violate amazon's external communications policy, which forbids employees from speaking about the company's business without approval from management.  in their complaint to the nlrb, costa and cunningham allege that amazon violated federal labor law by firing them ""based on discriminatory enforcement of policies or work rules, including its non-solicitation and communication policies.""  amazon's external communications policies also ""chill and restrain employees in the exercise"" of rights and activities that are protected by federal labor laws, according to the complaint, which was filed by a representative from the seattle chapter of the united food and commercial workers union.  the nlrb decision comes as amazon is staring down a closely-watched union vote at one of its alabama warehouses. the nlrb began counting votes last week and it could take a few days or weeks to reach an outcome.  the union vote is just the latest turning point in amazon's growing tensions with its frontline workforce. warehouse and delivery workers have raised concerns about a lack of coronavirus safety measures during the pandemic, along with other issues around working conditions.  a number of amazon employees who spoke out about pandemic working conditions have since filed complaints with the nlrb alleging the company illegally fired them, among other company retaliations. the nlrb has sided with the amazon workers in several cases, while other cases are ongoing.  enough amazon workers have filed charges against the company over the last year that the nlrb is considering launching a national investigation, nbc news reported last month.  -- reuters contributed to this report."
2021-04-06 23:30:59,"new york (cnn busienss) as the white house considers raising taxes on corporations for the first time in more than 25 years, the head of one of america's largest companies is backing such a plan.  ceo jeff bezossaid in a statement tuesday that the company is ""supportive of a rise in the corporate tax rate.""  ""we support the biden administration's focus on making bold investments in american infrastructure,"" bezos said. ""both democrats and republicans have supported infrastructure in the past, and it's the right time to work together to make this happen. we recognize this investment will require concessions from all sides — both on the specifics of what's included as well as how it gets paid for.""  the white house is laying the groundwork for lifting the corporate tax rate above its current level of 21% to help pay for an ambitious infrastructure package . bezos' statement is a notable show of approval for the move given that many others in the business community have warned that it could threaten recovery from the pandemic.  the outgoing amazon chief executive is, in some ways, a surprising advocate for a corporate tax hike.  in 2019, the then-former vice president joe biden called out amazon for its history of using tax credits and deductions to reduce its corporate income tax bill. the company fired back , saying, ""we pay every penny we owe,"" and that it had paid $2.6 billion in corporate taxes since 2016.  and again last year, then-presidential candidate biden said amazon should ""start paying their taxes,"" as part of a broader critique of large, successful businesses. amazon has repeatedly said that it follows all applicable tax laws.  the company also recently sparred with sen. elizabeth warren, who has advocated for raising taxes on big corporations . last month warren said in a tweet : ""giant corporations like amazon report huge profits to their shareholders — but they exploit loopholes and tax havens to pay close to nothing in taxes. that's just not right.""  amazon responded to her, saying : ""you make the tax laws @senwarren; we just follow them. if you don't like the laws you've created, by all means, change them. here are the facts: amazon has paid billions of dollars in corporate taxes over the past few years alone.""  for the 2017 and 2018 tax years, amazon's financial filings showed that it expected to receive money back from the federal government, not that it owed money in income tax. for the 2019 tax year, amazon said it owed more than $1 billion in federal income tax.  while it has already drawn some criticism, the biden administration's infrastructure plan may be compelling enough to convince more corporate leaders to sign on in support of hiking business taxes.  bezos said in his statement: ""we look forward to congress and the administration coming together to find the right, balanced solution that maintains or enhances u.s. competitiveness.""  and he's not alone. rick rieder, chief investment officer of global fixed income for blackrock, the world's largest asset manager, said rolling back trump-era corporate tax cuts won't hurt the economy — and could actually be positive for growth.  rieder told cnn business last month that he thinks the us economy can ""definitely"" withstand higher corporate taxes, and suggested that raising the corporate rate could help ensure that economic gains are distributed more evenly among corporations and workers.  ""the us economy is amazingly resilient,"" he said, ""and in fact will perform well when you get some of this income redistribution and consumption at an easier and a better place, particularly for lower and middle income.""  --cnn's brian fung and matt egan contributed to this report  --correction: an earlier version of this story misstated the percentage of amazon's 2019 income it owed in total us federal income taxes that year."

""we recognize this investment will require concessions from all sides — both on the specifics of what's included as well as how it gets paid for (we're supportive of a rise in the corporate tax rate).""  last week, biden unveiled a more than $2 trillion package that outlines sweeping upgrades to the nation's bridges, roads, public transport and airports, among other transportation infrastructure. it also included investments in care for elderly and disabled americans, building and retrofitting affordable housing and advancing american manufacturing and job-training efforts, among other goals.  to fund the package, biden has proposed hiking the corporate tax rate to 28% from 21%. the corporate tax rate had been cut under president donald trump to 21% from 35% as part of a 2017 tax law.  bezos' support for a tax increase is notable given that amazon has previously faced scrutiny over its tax record, including from biden. last may, biden, then a presidential candidate, told cnbc that amazon ""should start paying their taxes.""  biden singled out amazon again last week during an address in pittsburgh, slamming the company for using ""various loopholes so they'd pay not a single solitary penny in federal income tax.""  in response, amazon's top spokesperson, jay carney, said in a tweet: ""if the r&d tax credit is a 'loophole,' it's certainly one congress strongly intended. the r&d tax credit has existed since 1981, was extended 15 times with bi-partisan support and was made permanent in 2015 in a law signed by president obama.""  after paying $0 in u.s. federal income tax for two years, amazon paid $162 million in federal income taxes in 2019. the company, which benefits from a variety of tax credits and deductions, reported total revenue last year of $386 billion.  — cnbc's jacob pramuk contributed to this report."

2021-04-06 22:27:18,"amazon founder jeff bezos today endorsed the biden administration’s call for a higher corporate tax rate to help pay for the nation’s crumbling infrastructure.  in a statement posted on his company’s website, bezos noted that historically both democrats and republicans have called for additional infrastructure spending — federal money for everything from bridges to high-speed internet. then, he added, american companies should help pay for it.  “we recognize this investment will require concessions from all sides—both on the specifics of what’s included as well as how it gets paid for (we’re supportive of a rise in the corporate tax rate),” he wrote.  the news comes a week after president joe biden twice mentioned the company by name in a speech touting his infrastructure plan, saying u.s. companies such as amazon “use various loopholes so they pay not a single solitary penny in federal income tax.”  “a fireman, a teacher paying 22% — amazon and 90 other major corporations paying zero in federal taxes? i’m going to put an end to that,” he added.  the $2.3 trillion plan calls for a $600-billion investment in modernizing roads, improved rail cars, and buses and a national network of electric vehicle recharging stations. additional money is earmarked for veterans hospitals, improved affordable housing, and additional high-speed broadband — which became a pressing issue following many state mandates for at-home schooling during the pandemic.  to pay for the plan, president biden proposed raising the corporate tax rate to 28% from 21%. former president donald trump had cut the corporate tax rate to 21% from 35% in 2017.  some observers have cast a skeptical eye on bezos’ endorsement of higher corporate taxes. in his statement, the amazon boss didn’t specifically endorse the infrastructure plan or its 7 percent tax hike. the company historically has paid little or no taxes while using a myriad of tax credits and deductions to reduce its federal tax bill.  also because amazon reinvests much of its earnings, it often shows low profit margins even when posting record revenue. amazon reported revenue of $386 billion last year and operating income of $22.9 billion, boosted by a pandemic-driven surge amid as customers relied on its online shopping and cloud computing services.  amazon also remains under public and government scrutiny on several additional fronts including antitrust issues, and the working conditions of its lowest-paid employees. amazon warehouse workers in bessemer, ala., are waiting for the final count on a vote to unionize. it would be the first unionized workforce at the online retail and cloud-computing giant."
2021-04-06 22:15:15,"malls that buckled due to e-commerce or suffered during the pandemic are being given new life by the very entity that precipitated their decline — amazon.  over the last several months, the retail giant has gone on a shopping spree of its own, buying up disused malls across the country and turning them into distribution centers.  in march, amazon won approval to turn a mall in baton rouge, louisiana, into a 3.4 million-square-foot distribution building, and a mall in knoxville, tennessee, into a 220,000-square-foot distribution center. in december, the local planning board in worcester, massachusetts, signed off on amazon's request to convert the city's greendale mall into a 121,000-square-foot distribution center.  between 2016 and 2019, amazon converted around 25 shopping malls, according to an analysis by coresight research. last year, it was reportedly in talks with simon property group, the country's biggest mall owner, to convert bankrupt jcpenney and sears department stores into fulfillment centers. target and walmart have also turned some space in their own stores into mini fulfillment centers.  the knoxville center mall in knoxville, tenn. google  “the reality is that the cash flow at these lower-quality malls is declining rapidly,” said vince tibone, lead retail and industrial analyst at the real estate analytics firm green street. “you have to decide, ‘do i want to do something myself to invest a lot of money to transform this dead retail into thriving retail or put up offices?’ selling a dead mall as land is a more attractive option.”  about 50 percent of mall-based department stores could permanently close by the end of 2021, according to green street. the majority of these mall closures are expected to be lower-tier shopping centers that make less than $320 per square foot of space, which makes it difficult to cover their mortgages, tibone said.  malls are already struggling to keep up with mortgage debt. macerich, which runs about 50 shopping centers across the country, announced in february it is restructuring to rein in $1.5 billion in debt that comes due in july. cbl properties, whose major tenants include victoria's secret and foot locker, reached an agreement in march with lenders to shave $1.6 billion from its balance sheet.  ""selling a dead mall as land is a more attractive option.”  nikki forman, a spokesperson for amazon, declined to comment on its future plans to build on dead mall real estate. but she said the company is “constantly exploring new locations and weighing a variety of factors when deciding where to develop future sites to best serve customers.”  local hubs  amazon’s signature prime delivery depends on its national network of more than 100 fulfillment centers and roughly 1 million workers to get packages to a customer's front door within a day — or even an hour.  the pandemic has only accelerated amazon’s retail business, as stores closed and people hunkered down at home to curb coronavirus infections. net sales increased 37 percent in 2020 compared to the year before, leading the company to invest roughly $44 billion in capital expenditures, brian olsavsky, amazon’s chief financial officer, told investors in february. its fulfillment center footprint grew by 50 percent in 2020 compared to the year before, he said.  “in a [fulfillment center] world, it's hard to turn that capacity on quickly, so it generally means you may have to overbuild to protect the customer experience,” he said.  cortana mall in baton rouge will be amazon's third distribution center in the area. owned by moonbeam capital investments and located in the east end of the city at the intersection of two major highways, the 1.4 million-square-foot mall has been on the decline since the years following the great recession. the mall was put on the market and taken off in 2018 because of a lack of interest. at the beginning of this year, the mall’s last remaining store, dillard's clearance center, announced it would close.  “a lot of these malls that are going to the block, in a lot of cases the mortgage debt on the mall is worth more than the mall,” alex goldfarb, a senior research analyst at piper sandler, said. “you could easily have a mall that’s $50 million to $100 million in mortgage debt that gets sold for $20 million because there really aren't any tenants left and you’re selling for land value.”  amazon's fulfillment center footprint grew by 50 percent in 2020.  amazon bought the cortana mall property earlier this year for about $17 million, according to the east baton rouge clerk of court. that amounts to only about $6 a square foot. additionally, the east baton rouge metro council approved a $35 million tax abatement for seefried properties to develop the project on behalf of amazon.  while moonbeam did not respond to nbc news' request for comment, baton rouge mayor sharon weston broome said in a statement in march that she is in full support of the rezoning of the development of the former cortana mall.  “this generational project will create 1,000 new jobs for area residents,” she said. “today's rezoning of cortana mall will be critical to moving this project forward.""  angry locals  but in worcester, massachusetts, where amazon is building a distribution center on the site of a former mall, the company has received community pushback. at a planning commission meeting in december, dozens of people testified against the development, raising concerns about traffic, noise, labor conditions, emissions, impact on small businesses and the company’s anti-union efforts.  “is this going to be community development, and what commitments is amazon going to make to our community?” kevin ksen, a 40-year resident of worcester who spoke at the meeting, told nbc news. “the response from most of us was, ‘what are you going to do in terms of workers to make sure they’re treated well, and are you going to be hiring union workers on these projects?’”  jessica schumer, an economic development manager with amazon, said at the december meeting that the distribution center will create 70 new jobs that pay at least $15 an hour with full benefits. she also noted several examples of amazon’s donations to local school districts and housing organizations. at the end of the month, amazon got the green light to build.  greendale mall in worcester, mass. google  ksen said in an interview that he had hoped finard properties, the mall owner, would go through with its announced plans to transform the fading shopping center into a mixed-use location with shopping and housing. now, with amazon coming to town, he’s worried that the community won’t reap any benefits.  “i’ve seen the economic development happen to our community — it’s frustrating on a local level,” he said. “but, at the same time, i see a regular list of articles about amazon building here and amazon building there. i’m not sure any of us really fully understand the implications because it’s happening so so fast.”  other benefits  back in tennessee, knox county mayor glenn jacobs said the new amazon last mile distribution center is a welcome relief for the city, which had been losing money on the property. as sales waned, the mall’s owner, knoxville partners, became delinquent on roughly $600,000 in property taxes.  amazon plans to hire 700 workers for the distribution center and has not requested a tax abatement for the project, he said.  while the county won’t earn as much property tax on a warehouse property compared to a mall, jacobs said amazon will have a broader impact on the local economy.  “it is the indirect impact of people who work there having more money in their pockets and spending more money and buying homes or renting apartments that will lead to tax increases that we have direct benefit from,” he said."

2021-04-06 13:58:49,"an amazon-sponsored billboard urging employees to return their unionization ballots is seen on march 28, 2021 in bessemer, alabama. elijah nouvelage | getty images  amazon workers around the world are anxiously awaiting the results of a high-stakes union election at one of the company's warehouses in bessemer, alabama. voting wrapped up on march 29 in the election to determine whether roughly 5,800 workers at the bhm1 warehouse will join the retail, wholesale and department store union. vote counting began the next day and the public portion of the count is expected to begin as soon as wednesday. the effort has shaped up to be one of the most consequential union elections in recent history. if they win, the workers would establish the first union at a u.s. amazon facility, marking a major victory for workers in the face of amazon's staunch anti-union efforts. the election is being closely watched by workers, labor advocates, politicians and other groups for its potential to kickstart future organizing attempts elsewhere. the rwdsu has already heard from more than 1,000 u.s. amazon workers who are eager to organize. with ballots mailed in and vote counting underway, it may seem that amazon and the union are nearing the finish line in the election. but the process is likely far from over. both sides can contest ballots, and depending on the outcome of the vote, further legal battles could lie down the road. here's what to expect as the union election continues:  what's happening now  a week ago tuesday, the first stage of counting kicked off via a private video conference. during this portion, the national labor relations board will call out each voter's name, which is listed on a yellow envelope that contains a sealed blue envelope with their marked ballot inside. the actual ballot that lists each worker's vote is anonymous. amazon and the union will be allowed to contest ballots based on factors like whether an employee's job title entitles them to vote or an illegible signature. employee eligibility could shape up to be a major reason for contested ballots because turnover at amazon warehouses can be high. additionally, reuters reported last month that ballots were sent out to some employees who no longer work at amazon. if the envelope is contested, it will be set aside. if it's unchallenged, the nlrb will remove the blue ballot envelope and place it in the ballot box. it's unclear how many ballots were cast out of the 5,800 employees that were eligible to vote, but it's likely that the nlrb will have to sort through thousands of envelopes. the sheer size of the bargaining unit, combined with the fact that votes were submitted via mail, has meant that the election process has taken longer than usual.  signs reading ""vote"" hang outside the amazon.com, inc. bhm1 fulfillment center on march 28, 2021 in bessemer, alabama. patrick t. fallon | afp | getty images  ""when you have a facility that is that large, it adds to the amount of time that is going to be taken in the counting process,"" said mark pearce, an nlrb chairman during the obama administration and executive director of the workers' rights institute at georgetown university law center. ""so the timetable for a final count is kind of fluid."" last friday, the nlrb finished sifting through half of the mailed-in ballots, putting them on track to begin the public portion of the vote count as soon as wednesday, though the timing could still shift. once the private portion is complete, the nlrb will begin to count the unchallenged ballots in a public session open to members of the media. to win, the union needs a simple majority of the votes cast at amazon's bessemer warehouse. if there are enough challenged ballots to affect the outcome, the final tally will be temporarily halted until those challenges are resolved. ""so that also puts more time on the clock before a final result comes in,"" pearce said.  future challenges could prolong the process  challenged ballots aren't the only procedure that could prolong the process. after the ballots are tallied, either amazon or the rwdsu can raise objections over conduct during the election. those objections must be filed to the nlrb's regional director within five days of the final tally. the regional director will investigate the claims, and if there's sufficient evidence, it will schedule a hearing where each side can present evidence. for instance, an employer could argue that a union gave out gifts to sway voters, or the union could file an objection or an unfair labor practice charge, saying that the employer gave out raises to induce workers to vote no, pearce said. amazon could find itself in hot water when it comes to one particular benefit program, pearce said. the company has an annual program, referred to as ""the offer,"" that gives full-time workers the option to resign from their role in exchange for an exit bonus starting at $1,000. ""the offer"" wouldn't be considered unlawful outside of an election, but the nlrb might consider the program to be an election violation during a union campaign, under the guise that it violated workers' rights that are protected under the national labor relations act, pearce said. ""if that program is not suspended, there is most assuredly going to be objections and unfair labor practice charges filed with regard to that,"" pearce said. ""the complaint could be that this program is inherently destructive of an employee's right to pursue unionizing, even if the employer maintains that there's no evidence of unlawful motive."" amazon disputed claims that ""the offer"" is related to the union vote in bessemer. the annual program, launched in 2014, was extended to employees in north america this year between feb. 24 and march 16. amazon spokesperson heather knox told cnbc in a statement: ""while we hope employees stay with and grow their careers at amazon, this is a voluntary program that's designed to provide extra support for those who decide that amazon isn't part of their long-term career plan.""  people protest in support of the unionizing efforts of the alabama amazon workers, in los angeles, california, march 22, 2021. lucy nicholson | reuters"
