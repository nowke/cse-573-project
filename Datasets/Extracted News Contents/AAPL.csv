2021-04-02 23:02:33,"apple will use tesla battery packs for a large-scale solar energy and battery storage project that eventually will help power the iphone maker's headquarters.  apple (aapl) - get report plans to use tesla (tsla) - get report battery packs for a large-scale solar energy and battery storage project at a northern california farm that eventually will help power the iphone maker's headquarters.  the verge reported wednesday that cupertino-based apple will tap tesla’s battery packs and related technology as part of a solar farm project it spearheaded in 2015 to help power the company’s main campus.  the setup, which was approved by the monterey county board of supervisors in 2020, will consist of 85 tesla lithium-ion “megapacks” and store up to 240 megawatt-hours of energy, according to the verge, citing an email from monterey county’s planning chief.  apple said in a statement that the “california flats” project will be “one of the largest battery projects in the country,” and will support its solar farm that generates 130-megawatt hours and supplies all of apple's renewable energy in california. it didn't mention tesla.  apple added wednesday that more than 110 of its manufacturing partners around the world are moving to 100% renewable energy for production. the iphone maker last july pledged to be 100% carbon neutral by 2030.  in tesla's case, investors have been more focused on its car production and output vs. its battery production efforts. the automaker is expected to have delivered 174,000 new cars in the first three months of 2021, well above what it churned out a year ago but short of what it produced and sold in the fourth quarter.  tesla daily’s rob maurer reported earlier this week that tesla was applying for approval to build a battery cell factory in berlin, part of the company’s ongoing push to own its own energy generating ecosystem.  meantime, president joe biden on wednesday rolled out his administration's $2.25 infrastructure plan, which includes a bevy of ""green energy"" initiatives including transitioning the country's electricity grid to renewable energy sources, and creating a nation-wide electric-vehicle charging network.  shares of apple were up 1.04% at $123.42, while tesla shares were up 2.64% at $685.55."
2021-04-02 21:07:21,"apple announced wednesday that it’s building a big battery storage project at a northern california solar farm it spearhead in 2015. but what the company didn’t share is that the battery packs will come from tesla, the verge has learned.  the newly-announced setup, which will store up to 240 megawatt-hours of energy, was approved by the monterey county board of supervisors in 2020, according to documents submitted last year. it will consist of 85 tesla lithium-ion “megapacks” and be used to help power the company’s corporate headquarters in cupertino. monterey county’s planning chief confirmed that apple will use the tesla batteries in an email to the verge. apple declined to comment. tesla did not respond to a request for comment.  tesla first announced the megapack battery system back in 2019. the 60mw storage setup apple will be using is not tesla’s biggest, though. the company has built bigger overall battery storage solutions in australia and south of houston, texas of around 100mw in size. still, apple touted it as “one of the largest battery projects in the country” in a press release, saying the battery system could power more than 7,000 homes for a whole day. the tesla batteries will make it possible for apple to store energy generated by its 130-megawatt solar array at the farm, which is called california flats.  the project was quietly approved last year  “the challenge with clean energy — solar and wind — is that it’s by definition intermittent,” apple vp lisa jackson told reuters on wednesday. “if we can do it, and we can show that it works for us, it takes away the concerns about intermittency and it helps the grid in terms of stabilization. it’s something that can be imitated or built upon by other companies.”  while apple uses lithium-ion batteries in many of its products, it’s not known to be working on any grid-scale projects. the company is reportedly developing a lithium iron phosphate battery for its electric car project, though.  apple and tesla don’t have much overlapping history, though each company is notorious for poaching talent from the other. tesla ceo elon musk also said in december that he tried to pitch the idea of apple buying his company back in 2018, but that apple ceo tim cook “refused” to take the meeting.  tesla is best known for its electric cars, but it’s spent years trying to build up an energy storage business to compliment the solar products it acquired when it bought solar city. it has gotten increasingly involved in large-scale energy storage projects like apple’s over the years in addition to its home battery business.  while it’s still modest compared to the billions of dollars generated by tesla’s car business, the energy storage division’s products has already netted at least one other strange bedfellow customer: in 2019, volkswagen announced it was using tesla batteries at some of its electrify america charging stations."
2021-04-02 18:46:01,"a us federal judge has found merit in a lawsuit alleging that apple sold defective macbook pro laptops despite being aware of the quality issues.  referred to in some circles as flexgate, the issue centers on macbook pro machines sold since 2016 that have notoriously flimsy flex display cables that apparently begin to wear out after a short period of use. this results in weird display anomalies, most notably the ""stage light"" effect, when too much backlight bleeds through the bottom bezel of the panel.  in the lawsuit, the complainants allege that apple’s extensive pre-release testing, which would have included stress tests, must surely have brought the issue with the cables to the company's attention.  here are some of the best business macs  these are the best business computers currently available  and, here's our list of the best business laptops  “the court finds that the allegations of pre-release testing in combination with the allegations of substantial customer complaints are sufficient to show that apple had exclusive knowledge of the alleged defect,” wrote judge edward davila in his order.  in the know  apple’s response to the issue when it first came to light didn’t help matters either. the complainants assert that not only did apple silently replace the cables in newer macbooks, but also that the firm deleted forum posts about the issue.  the company is also said to have refused to replace the defective components, until thousands of users signed an online petition.  notably, flexgate has already led to one class action lawsuit based around the macbook keyboard.  however, according to law360, although judge davila has allowed the flex cable lawsuit to proceed, he has narrowed its scope. a class-action lawsuit has not yet been certified, but the judge has invited the nine plaintiffs to submit a new amended complaint.  need something more portable? check out the best mobile workstations  via the verge"
2021-04-02 18:35:08,"(reuters) - apple inc chief executive officer tim cook on thursday was the latest corporate leader to speak out against the state of georgia’s new voting restrictions, which many critics say targets blacks and other racial minorities.  “american history is the story of expanding the right to vote to all citizens, and black people, in particular, have had to march, struggle and even give their lives for more than a century to defend that right,” cook said in a statement.  the republican-backed georgia law strengthened identification requirements for absentee ballots, shortened early voting periods for runoffs and made it a misdemeanor for members of the public to offer food and water to voters waiting in line.  “apple believes that, thanks in part to the power of technology, it ought to be easier than ever for every eligible citizen to exercise their right to vote,” cook said.  the measure, which has also been slammed by democratic president joe biden, faces legal challenges from civil rights groups that contend it is aimed at suppressing voting among blacks and other racial minorities.  on wednesday, major u.s. companies led a charge to challenge the law, with several executives making statements against voting restrictions."
2021-04-02 13:14:41,"apple’s gaming subscription service just got a massive influx of new titles. the headliner is fantasian — the latest release from the creator of final fantasy — which is joined by other titles like new versions of nba 2k and the oregon trail, and world of demons from platinumgames. as part of the update, the service is getting two new categories of games: apple calls them “timeless classics” and “app store greats.”  for the greats, apple is adding a number of high-profile mobile hits to the service, including threes, monument valley, mini metro, and a remaster of cut the rope. timeless classics, meanwhile, refers to iconic games like backgammon, solitaire, and zach gage’s recent takes on chess and sudoku. while most arcade games are playable across apple tv, mac, and ios, these new categories will only work on iphone and ipad. the update adds more than 30 titles to the service, bringing the entire library to more than 180.  apple arcade first launched in 2019 as a new option for premium games on a platform that had become dominated by free-to-play experiences. the original pitch was a service full of new, largely exclusive games from developers like final fantasy creator hironobu sakaguchi and a number of indie stalwarts.  however, despite the quality games and relative low price (an arcade subscription is $4.99 per month), apple is reportedly not happy with the amount of engagement games are getting, which may be a reason behind this most recent shift in direction."
2021-04-02 12:38:23,"when apple introduced its controversial macbook pro redesign in 2016, the company probably didn’t know it was setting itself up to get sued — but not only is a class-action lawsuit now underway for their infamous butterfly keyboards, it’s looking likely there’ll be a second one for their notoriously fragile display cables, too. judge edward davila has decided to let the “flexgate” lawsuit go forward, ruling that apple should have known that they would fail and yet kept selling them anyhow.  “the court finds that the allegations of pre-release testing in combination with the allegations of substantial customer complaints are sufficient to show that apple had exclusive knowledge of the alleged defect,” the judge wrote (via law360 and 9to5mac). you can read the full order at the bottom of this post.  also known as stage light  to see what the issue looked like, just take a peek at our picture atop this post; it’s sometimes called the “stage light” issue because of how the cable damage would produce those dark spots.  part of the flexgate controversy is around how apple addressed the issue when it first got publicity in late 2018 — first by silently swapping a new, slightly longer cable into newer macbooks, and only opening up one of its typical free repair programs months after 15,000 users signed a petition and it was called out in the press. the company’s been a lot more responsive with issues ever since, such as with this free battery replacement program for a small number of those 2016 and 2017 macbook pro laptops that won’t charge anymore.  unlike the butterfly keyboard suit, the flexgate one doesn’t appear to be a certified class-action lawsuit yet — but there are now nine different plaintiffs lined up in this single case, and the judge is inviting them to submit a new amended complaint. we’ll be watching to see where it goes from there."

2021-04-02 01:34:12,"thinking about picking up a new apple watch? it’s never a bad idea to wait until there’s a good deal, and thankfully, those happen with some regularity.  there are currently three models to choose from, all of which support watchos 7. the latest model, and the highest end, is the apple watch series 6 with gps and wi-fi connectivity, which starts at $399. if that’s a little too expensive, you can drop about $120 off the price by buying an apple watch se, which also launched this fall.  finally, the three-year-old series 3 is the most affordable apple watch model to date. it has a starting retail price of $199, but it frequently goes on sale. if you’re looking for something to last a few years, though, it’s probably worth looking at one of the other two watches, as it’s not clear how much longer apple will deliver software updates to the series 3.  while deals are a fairly regular occurrence, there will be times where there are no price drops on new models. for those times, we also include some deals on refurbished models.  apple watch series 3 deals  the regular price for the 38mm series 3 is $199 ($229 for the 42mm), which is a decent deal. it’s a great entry-level apple watch if you are looking for a smartwatch with reliable battery life and don’t want to burn a massive hole in your wallet.  apple watch apple watch series 3 (38mm, gps) $169  $199  16% off prices taken at time of publishing. the apple watch series 3 is the most affordable watch in apple’s lineup, and it makes a good entry-level apple wearable. $169 at walmart  currently, the 38mm series 3 is $169 at walmart, which is $34 off its usual price of $199. if you are looking for the series 3 in 42mm, walmart has knocked $30 off this model’s retail price as well, bringing it down to $174.  apple watch se deals  starting at $279 for a 40mm version or $309 for the 44mm, the apple watch se is a good midrange wearable and shares some features also found on the flagship series 6 model, such as a built-in accelerometer and hand-washing detection. but it doesn’t have the always-on display found on the series 5 and series 6.  the best deal right now on the apple watch se 40mm with gps is at amazon, which has the configuration on sale for $270 in gold and space gray.  the 44mm with gps is also on sale at several retailers. the lowest you can currently get this model for at amazon is $289 in gold or white. walmart also has this model on sale for $289 in rose gold and white.  the flagship apple watch comes in two sizes, 40mm and 44mm, with respective starting costs of $399 and $429. the apple watch series 6 features more sensors than previous models, including a sensor that allows the device to detect your body's blood oxygen levels.  if you are looking for the 40mm with gps, amazon has the lowest price right now for this model: $349 if you buy the watch in red and navy blue. walmart has the series 6 40mm for $349 in red and white.  if you want a 40mm model that supports gps and cellular, amazon has this configuration down to its lowest price of $449 in gold, navy blue, red, space gray, and white."
2021-04-02 01:31:49,"apple announced wednesday that it’s building a big battery storage project at a northern california solar farm it spearhead in 2015. but what the company didn’t share is that the battery packs will come from tesla, the verge has learned.  the newly-announced setup, which will store up to 240 megawatt-hours of energy, was approved by the monterey county board of supervisors in 2020, according to documents submitted last year. it will consist of 85 tesla lithium-ion “megapacks” and be used to help power the company’s corporate headquarters in cupertino. monterey county’s planning chief confirmed that apple will use the tesla batteries in an email to the verge. apple declined to comment. tesla did not respond to a request for comment.  tesla first announced the megapack battery system back in 2019. the 60mw storage setup apple will be using is not tesla’s biggest, though. the company has built bigger overall battery storage solutions in australia and south of houston, texas of around 100mw in size. still, apple touted it as “one of the largest battery projects in the country” in a press release, saying the battery system could power more than 7,000 homes for a whole day. the tesla batteries will make it possible for apple to store energy generated by its 130-megawatt solar array at the farm, which is called california flats.  the project was quietly approved last year  “the challenge with clean energy — solar and wind — is that it’s by definition intermittent,” apple vp lisa jackson told reuters on wednesday. “if we can do it, and we can show that it works for us, it takes away the concerns about intermittency and it helps the grid in terms of stabilization. it’s something that can be imitated or built upon by other companies.”  while apple uses lithium-ion batteries in many of its products, it’s not known to be working on any grid-scale projects. the company is reportedly developing a lithium iron phosphate battery for its electric car project, though.  apple and tesla don’t have much overlapping history, though each company is notorious for poaching talent from the other. tesla ceo elon musk also said in december that he tried to pitch the idea of apple buying his company back in 2018, but that apple ceo tim cook “refused” to take the meeting.  tesla is best known for its electric cars, but it’s spent years trying to build up an energy storage business to compliment the solar products it acquired when it bought solar city. it has gotten increasingly involved in large-scale energy storage projects like apple’s over the years in addition to its home battery business.  while it’s still modest compared to the billions of dollars generated by tesla’s car business, the energy storage division’s products has already netted at least one other strange bedfellow customer: in 2019, volkswagen announced it was using tesla batteries at some of its electrify america charging stations."

2021-04-03 15:58:37,"show caption the lucid air’s promised acceleration of 0-60mph in 2.5 seconds would outpace a ferrari – but with zero exhaust carbon emissions. photograph: lucid automotive industry meet the briton leading a tesla rival who wants to save the planet peter rawlinson says lucid, which is about to list for $24bn, has drawn interest from big carmakers jasper jolly @jjpjolly sat 3 apr 2021 03.00 edt share on facebook  share on twitter  share via email  the lucid motors boss peter rawlinson is fluent in the language of the new breed of electric carmaker: he wants to save the planet and he wants to do it fast.  the california carmaker is only starting production of its hotly anticipated first model in the second half of this year but it has quickly come to be seen as one of the leaders in the pack of would-be rivals to tesla. a recent $24bn (£17bn) deal to list on us stock markets will give it $4.6bn in funds to play with.  such is the urgency of the “impending environmental crisis” facing the world, according to rawlinson, that lucid is hoping to work with mass-market carmakers to get its technology into production as soon as possible.  lucid has been “approached by a few car companies this year” over licensing deals, rawlinson told the guardian. those talks have yielded “nothing tangible” yet and the prospect of earning revenues from partnerships with other carmakers, he says, remains very speculative. however, there is “mouthwatering potential”, and the right partner could yield an affordable electric car within four years, he says.  lucid’s peter rawlinson says talks with other carmakers have yielded ‘nothing tangible’ yet. photograph: lucid  he declined to comment when asked if lucid had been approached by apple, the iphone maker that is considering making an electric car.  “the big picture is, i’ve got this dichotomy,” rawlinson said, speaking via video call from california. “the dichotomy is we need to get millions of $25,000 cars into production fast to save the planet. we’ve got the right technology but as a company i can’t get there for about eight, nine years, and it’s too late.”  a deal with carmakers such as honda, hyundai or toyota (named by rawlinson) would be the “icing on the cake” for a company – still without a single car sale – which has become one of the flagbearers of the us electric car spac boom (or bubble, according to taste). rivals that are also using special purpose acquisition companies (spacs) to list in the us include the uk’s arrival and the us’s canoo, fisker, lordstown and rivian – on top of chinese contenders such as li auto, nio and xpeng.  rawlinson is arguably britain’s most influential carmaker – albeit one firmly based in california  what sets lucid’s spac apart is its size. the $4.6bn funding it will get from the listing, if completed, will include $2.1bn directly from the spac cash shell and another $2.5bn from investors led by saudi arabia’s sovereign wealth fund, which is its biggest shareholder.  that arguably makes rawlinson britain’s most influential carmaker – albeit one firmly based in california.  rawlinson grew up in south wales, going to school in cowbridge, near cardiff. he considered art school but instead studied mechanical engineering at imperial college london. he worked at jaguar and lotus in the uk before joining an ambitious new electric carmaker. that company was elon musk’s tesla, and rawlinson ended up as chief engineer for tesla’s model s.  in 2013, rawlinson moved to atieva, which made batteries for the electric formula e race series. atieva eventually decided to move into car production, and rawlinson persuaded it to change its name to lucid.  rawlinson is following the tesla business model closely, from targeting its first cars at wealthier buyers through to starting a home battery business on the side. rawlinson is complimentary about his former employer, saying it has “the best electric technology in production today”.  tomorrow might be a different matter. lucid’s claims for its cars have not yet been proven but they are extraordinary.  the lucid air, with production starting in the second half of this year, is aiming for a range of 517 miles for its $161,000 flagship model. such a long driving distance between recharging would put a stop to the “range anxiety”, which so many motorists cite as a drawback to buying electric.  the air’s promised acceleration of 0-60mph in 2.5 seconds would also outpace a ferrari – but with zero exhaust carbon emissions.  a deal with carmakers such as honda, hyundai or toyota would be the ‘icing on the cake’ for lucid. photograph: patrick t fallon/afp/getty images  there is not one big technological reveal for how this grand aim will be achieved. instead, lucid is slicing off inefficiencies wherever it can find them, with battery, gears, power electronics and motor all developed in-house. examples of important developments are batteries that have a simpler manufacturing process, or a motor that can have coolant pumped directly through it, allowing more efficient heat management.  lucid employs almost 2,000 people, with 3,000 workers expected to be added in the us by the end of 2022. the factory it has built in arizona can theoretically make 34,000 cars a year. by 2023 it is hoping for about 90,000 units when it will be selling a seven-seater suv that currently has the moniker “project gravity”.  by 2025 it speculates it will have revenues of $14bn – which would represent an astonishing growth rate. five years after that it hopes to produce 500,000 cars a year, possibly with factories in china and the middle east. that would still only be a fraction of mass-volume carmakers with similar valuations but it would not be for a lack of ambition on lucid’s part.  “all mankind will benefit from the technology we bring in this high-end product,” rawlinson said, “because it will cascade down to more affordable cars that we’re going to make in the future.”"
2021-04-04 23:05:15,"after a killer 2020, apple and tesla stocks have been underperforming this year. the apple maven looks at valuations and catalysts to assess which, if any, might be the best opportunity on the pullback.  two highflyers last year, apple and tesla stocks have been having a much tougher 2021 compared to the s&p 500.  shares of the cupertino company have been down 9% year-to-date and 15% from the late january all-time high. the stock of the electric vehicle maker has corrected even more: 12% in 2021 and a whopping 30% from the peak.  growth investors must be asking themselves if now is a good time to buy either apple stock or tesla stock on weakness. if so, which of them is the better buy?  without having the ability to look into a crystal ball and tell what will happen to these tech stocks in the future, the apple maven tries to answer the question from two angles: valuation and catalysts.  valuations: not a bargain  despite the noticeable pullback in both apple and tesla shares, neither can be considered a bargain.  apple stock currently trades at a current-year earnings ratio (also known as p/e) of about 28 times. this is about four turns below the peak 2021 valuation multiple, reached a mere two months ago.  however, rarely in history has apple traded at such rich multiples, even after the modest decline in the first quarter. to be clear, an argument can be made for why apple now deserves a higher valuation multiple, including:  more aggressive multi-year growth expectations in iphone sales through the 5g supercycle;  heavier revenue mix of more stable, higher margin service segment;  the rebirth of two product categories believed to be in secular decline: the mac and ipad;  short term interest rates near zero, which justifies more aggressive bets in risk assets.  in the case of tesla stock, valuations look even richer. the 2021 p/e has decreased quite a bit from a top of over 250 times, at the end of last year. still, at nearly 150 times, few can reasonably claim tesla’s to be a low current-year earnings multiple.  here is a fun fact: the electric car giant sells only about 500,000 vehicle per year, while gm sold 13 times this many in 2020. yet, tesla’s equity is valued at over half a trillion dollars, seven times more than gm’s market cap.  the problem is that quantifying the investment opportunity in tesla through the conventional methods makes little sense. to understand how tesla’s value might be reasonable (and, who knows, even understated), one must look much farther into the future.  this is exactly what cathie woods’ ark invest has done. the firm thinks that tsla can reach its price target of $3,000 within 5 years, for an upside opportunity of 400%. the catch, however, is that ark has to look at 2025 projected earnings. only then can the firm apply a much more reasonable ev/ebitda (another common valuation metric) of 16 times, compared to today’s aggressive 64 times multiple, to justify its bullish call.  catalysts: plenty on both sides  valuation alone is not enough to determine which stock is a better buy-on-weakness play. in fact, catalysts are often the most important factor in moving stock prices in the short-to-medium terms.  the cupertino company’s stock price could benefit from several bullish developments in the foreseeable future:  ironically, one of apple’s key catalysts might be entering tesla’s turf. the announcement of the apple car, if it happens soon, could be a major stock price mover;  apple has barely tapped the augmented (ar) and virtual reality (vr) opportunities. the launch of a mixed reality device in 2022 could be good news for the wearables segment and the stock;  should the 5g supercyle prove to be strong, fiscal 2021 financial results will start to reflect it through robust iphone 12 sales;  but when it comes to catalysts, tesla probably shines brighter than apple. back to ark’s investment thesis, even the firm’s more bearish case (let alone the bullish one) assumes that ceo elon musk’s company is staring at several key catalysts that could send the stock much higher:  a highly anticipated, rapid increase in electric car market share (relative to combustion engine vehicles) leading to substantially higher ev revenues;  the launch of a ride-hail service business – either human-driven or, much better, autonomous;  the expansion of tesla’s insurance business, possibly at better-than-industry margins, due to the detailed driving data that the company collects.  the verdict  it is hard to pin down the best buy-on-dip opportunity between apple and tesla stock, since the future is so uncertain. but in my view, apple probably makes for a more conservative play due to more de-risked valuations and less aggressive growth profile. tesla seems to be the higher risk, higher reward alternative for investors looking for a “higher octane” investment opportunity.  twitter speaks  tough question of the day: which is a better buy, aapl or tsla?

""this is a continuation of apple's long-standing commitment to diversity and inclusion, and products and services that are designed to better reflect the diversity of the world we live in,"" said apple, in a statement regarding the change.  apple has also announced that ios 14.5 will recalibrate maximum battery capacity and peak performance capability on iphone 11, 11 pro, and 11 pro max models to address inaccurate estimates of battery health reporting for some users. apple said the bug does not reflect an issue with actual battery health.  ios 14.5 has been in beta testing since february 1 and is packed with new features, such as the ability to unlock an iphone with an apple watch while wearing a mask, support for 5g in dual-sim mode on iphone 12 models, new waze-like features in apple maps, new emoji, airplay 2 streaming for apple fitness+ workouts, and much more. apple previously said the software update will be released for all compatible devices in ""early spring.""    apple researching mac pro's 'cheese grater' design for other devices like iphone  apple is considering expanding the 2019 mac pro's distinctive ""cheese grater"" lattice design to other devices, including the iphone and a ""trash can""-style ‌mac pro‌, according to a newly granted patent filing.    apple introduced the innovative milled lattice pattern on the ‌mac pro‌ and pro display xdr in 2019, which is created by machining a spherical array into the internal and external surfaces of the aluminum. the result is a lightweight lattice pattern that maximizes airflow while creating an extremely rigid structure.  while patent filings are typically all encompassing and cannot be taken as solid evidence of apple's plans for actual consumer hardware, they can provide an interesting view into the company's areas of research.    bitcoin scam app approved by apple robs iphone user of $600,000+  a scam bitcoin app that was designed to look like a genuine app was accepted by apple's app store review team and ended up costing an iphone user 17.1 bitcoin, or upwards of $600,000 at the time of the theft, according to the washington post.    in a statement, apple said in the ""limited instances"" when criminals defraud its users, the company takes ""swift action"" to prevent similar violations in the future.

2021-04-04 08:47:02,"when apple (aapl) launched a new butterfly keyboard with the macbook pro some years ago, it was slapped with a class-action lawsuit for its defective keyboards. now a second class-action lawsuit could be in the making called ""flexgate.""  according to the verge, apple opted for fragile flex cables instead of beefier wires for its screens on macbook pro models in 2016. the new lawsuit, filed in the us district court for the northern district of california, is over the macbook pro developing ""stage light"" issues at the bottom of the screen, eventually leading to a complete failure.  law360 reports that us district judge edward davila decided this week to allow the ""flexgate"" lawsuit to move forward, ruling that apple knew it was selling defective macbook pros.  a california federal judge has trimmed a proposed class action against apple claiming it hid display defects on 15-inch macbook pro laptops but left intact fraudulent omission claims after determining the proposed class adequately alleged apple failed to disclose information concerning the alleged defect. us district judge edward davila determined that the consumers' allegations of apple conducting intensive pre-release testing, which the consumers say was conducted by a team of ""reliability engineers"" who carried out stress tests and other procedures that would have alerted apple to defects behind the display failures, sufficiently demonstrate that apple was aware of the alleged defect. the judge added that consumer complaints concerning the alleged display defect also would have put apple on alert. ""the court finds that the allegations of pre-release testing in combination with the allegations of substantial customer complaints are sufficient to show that apple had exclusive knowledge of the alleged defect,"" the judge wrote in his opinion.  the problem that apple incurred was that it switched to a thinner ribbon cable in the affected models that would result in a tear and eventual failure of the screen. the problem was so widespread, consistent, and infuriating to tens of thousands of apple users that it was mindboggling apple ceo tim cook would even allow the defective models even to be sold."

""energy generation and storage"" made up 6% of the company's total revenue in 2020, according to its end-of-year financial filing, though it grew by 30% from 2019.  the verge first reported on the connection between the two tech giants, pointing to records submitted by the monterey county board of supervisors.  tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  — cnbc's lora kolodny contributed to this report.  subscribe to cnbc on youtube."
2021-04-05 23:40:40,"archived recording (singing) when you walk in the room, do you have sway? [music playing]  kara swisher  i’m kara swisher, and you’re listening to “sway.” my guest today is apple ceo tim cook. he’s been at apple for 23 years and at the helm of the company for almost 10, having inherited the reins from the late steve jobs. when cook got the top job, apple’s market cap was close to $350 billion. today, it’s worth over $2 trillion. it churns out billions of devices that are hugely popular worldwide, but the company is also now in the crosshairs of antitrust investigators due to its massive size and power. epic games is suing apple, for example, alleging the company is a monopoly. and other developers are also complaining to regulators. meanwhile, some users of the so-called free speech network parler have also taken issue with apple for removing parler from its app store. it was a move made by apple and by google and amazon after the capitol attacks. they maintain that parler failed to moderate dangerous content related to the attempted insurrection on january 6. cook has also become a hero to some, doubling down in an impassioned speech and a major privacy conference recently, calling out the tech industry, especially social media companies, over misuse of consumer data.  archived recording (tim cook) if a business is built on misleading users on data exploitation, on choices that are no choices at all, then it does not deserve our praise. it deserves reform. we should not look away from the bigger picture. at a moment of rampant disinformation and conspiracy theories juiced by algorithms, we can no longer turn a blind eye to a theory of technology that says all engagement is good engagement.  kara swisher  tim cook, welcome to “sway.” that was quite a speech. i was surprised by how strongly you put it. you were talking about social media companies there and those that use data. you took parler off. how did you think about that decision?  tim cook  well, in some ways, it was a straightforward decision, because they were not adhering to the guidelines of the app store. you can’t be inciting violence or allow people to incite violence. you can’t allow hate speech and so forth. and they had moved from moderating to not being able to moderate. but we gave them a chance to cure that. and they were unable to do that or didn’t do that. and so we had to pull them off. now, having said that, kara, i hope that they come back on. because we work hard to get people on the store, not to keep people off the store. and so, i’m hoping that they put in the moderation that’s required to be on the store and come back, because i think having more social networks out there is better than having less.  kara swisher  the day of the attack, i was actually interviewing the c.e.o of parler. it was quite an astonishing interview. did you listen to what he said? he said, i don’t have responsibility. i don’t take any responsibility.  tim cook  and obviously, that doesn’t adhere to the app store terms and conditions.  kara swisher  yeah, you had been working with them previously on these issues, too.  tim cook  we believe that at a point in time, they were compliant.  kara swisher  and then they were not.  tim cook  and then they were not.  kara swisher  yeah, and lots of tech companies acted at the same time, whether it was amazon, google, you, and others. it was sort of like a house of cards sort of fell in on them. should it have been done before?  tim cook  it happened as soon as we became aware of it. and i’m not sure it would have taken the capitol event for that to occur. we would have taken it off when we became aware. after giving some time to cure, we would have taken it off. and again, i can’t stress enough, i hope they come back.  kara swisher  yeah, i want to talk about the hearings on capitol hill last month. you weren’t there, but the ceos of three tech companies were — mark zuckerberg of facebook, jack dorsey of twitter, and sundar pichai from google and alphabet. congressman mike doyle asked all three tech executives to answer yes or no to the same question, which was a little reductive. i would have asked it slightly differently. but he wanted to know whether their companies bore any responsibility for spreading misinformation and planning the attack on the capitol. they didn’t answer. they sort of tried to walk around it. jack dorsey kind of answered — said yes, but, essentially. how would you have answered for those companies or for apple, or technology in general?  tim cook  well, i can only speak for apple. and from the very start, we’ve always believed in curation. and so we review every app that goes on the store. that doesn’t mean that we’re perfect at doing it. we’re not. but we care deeply about what we’re offering our users. and when we have a news product like apple news, we have human editors that are selecting the key stories. and so, they’re avoiding all of the misinformation that is out there. the reality is that the web in some areas has become a dark place. and without curation, you wind up with this firehose of things that i would not want to put into an amplifier.  kara swisher  right.  tim cook  which is what tech is, in a large way. if you have a platform, you amplify things.  kara swisher  do you consider apple an amplifier?  tim cook  well, i think in areas like the selection of stories on apple news, we have human editors do that. even though the app store isn’t a push, so we’re not pushing things in your feed like a social media company would be, a lot of people are coming to the app store. and so we want that to be a safe and trusted place to be.  kara swisher  what is the broader culpability of big tech in the context of things like the attack? because you did actually address it in your speech on privacy. a lot of people give some culpability to social media sites. and apple does not have one. ping never sort of took off. i remember ping was the social network apple had that —  tim cook  yeah, i do remember. i’m glad you reminded me.  kara swisher  yeah, i remember steve. he says, what do you think of ping? it sucks. and he’s like, yes, yeah, it does. it really does. but do you think social media sites were culpable in the attack?  tim cook  i think that the amplification of social media is something that i deeply worry about. and the targeting tools, the same tools that are used to target in advertising can be used to target for misinformation purposes or extremist purposes. and so i deeply worry about that. the people i fault the most for the capitol attack are the people that obviously were in the attack itself, that breached the capitol. but i think it’s incumbent on all of us to take a step back and ask, what were the other contributing factors? because we don’t want to repeat it. this was one of the darkest days in our history. and it played out in front of all of us. i felt like it was more of a movie or something, that it was something that was not real, that it couldn’t be happening in the united states of america. and so i’m hopeful that that deep inspection occurs.  kara swisher  so one of the things this calls for amending section 230, which is, of course, the part of the communications decency act that protects platforms from getting sued because of content of the user’s post. do you think liability is important?  tim cook  i’m not big on suing as a lever. i think 230, it was written at a time prior to lots of things that have come into existence. and they weren’t envisioned. and so, i think it’s time to revisit 230. but i don’t have an answer of what the perfect way to revise 230 would be.  kara swisher  so let’s talk about the solutions. i want to get into privacy, which apple has been pushing rather hard as well. how do you look at data and privacy bills that are being contemplated?  tim cook  generally speaking, i think privacy is one of the top issues of the 21st century. and i think we’re in a crisis.  kara swisher  ok.  tim cook  years ago, i thought companies would regulate themselves and sort of get better. i no longer believe that. and i’m not generally somebody that is keen on regulation, but i think that regulation is required.  kara swisher  what made you not believe it? what tipped you over?  tim cook  because i saw companies continually going outside of what i thought were reasonable rails.  kara swisher  mm-hmm. one of the things you said in that speech, if we accept as normal and unavoidable that everything in our lives can be aggregated and sold, we lose so much more than data. we lose freedom to be human. talk about what you meant by that.  tim cook  if you think about a surveillance world, a world where you know somebody is always watching everything you’re doing — and in the case of a phone or a computer, it’s also what you’re thinking, because you’re typing in searches and so on and so forth. and so i think in that kind of world, you begin to do less. you begin to think less. your freedom of expression begins to narrow. and the walls move in on you. and i start thinking about that at its natural endpoint. and i don’t want to be a part of that society.  kara swisher  and why is it important for apple to speak up on this? you sell the phones that allow these apps to do those things. you’ve used it as a brand attribute in advertising, very strong advertising standing up for privacy. why are you speaking out so strongly about it?  tim cook  it’s not about being a brand attribute, to be frank. for us, privacy is a basic human right. and it’s a right that other rights are built off of. it’s that kind of core. it’s bedrock. and it’s not something that i just decided a few years ago. as i remember, steve commented on this with you over a decade ago. he said something like, privacy means people know what they’re signing up for in plain english, repeatedly. the individual should own their data. and they should own the ability to say who gets it and what of their data they get and what they use it for. and frankly, that’s not the situation of today.  kara swisher  are you surprised by the amount of data thievery, essentially, that goes on?  tim cook  i’m appalled by it. and so we’ve got things coming out like a privacy nutrition label. privacy policies have become these multi-page things that people just blindly say, i agree, so that they can go to the next screen and move on. a privacy nutrition label, much like a nutrition label on food, gives you at a glance some key information. we’ll improve that over time. and then the one, kara, that’s probably gotten the most attention is called att.  kara swisher  yes, we’re going to get into that.  tim cook  app tracking transparency, and what it tries to get at is companies that are taking advantage of tracking you across apps of other companies, and therefore putting together an entire profile of what you’re thinking, what you’re doing, surveilling you across the web 24/7.  kara swisher  right, using devices you make as the vehicle to do so.  tim cook  they are using all technology for these, whether —  kara swisher  yeah, right. i’m just saying in your case. so let’s make it easy for people to understand. when exactly is the new update coming out?  tim cook  it’s just a few weeks now.  kara swisher  all right, and it’s called att, which is app tracking transparency.  tim cook  that’s right.  kara swisher  obviously, companies like facebook and many others make a lot of money from data collected from those trackers. how will the consumers see it? what is going to happen?  tim cook  they’ll see a simple pop-up that basically prompts them to answer the question of, are they ok with being tracked or not? if they are, things move on. if they’re not, then the tracking is turned off for that individual with respect to that specific app.  kara swisher  right, and will it tell them what’s tracking to let them make a decision? because just saying, do you want to be tracked, most people are like, stopped? no, no thank you.  tim cook  the developer can put essentially other information in there. maybe they say that it’s for better ads or better targeted ads or whatever. all we want to do is supply a tool so that the person that should make the decision can make it.  kara swisher  you’re guiding them there, though. you are guiding them to doing this. why did you decide to do this now?  tim cook  kara, every year, we add privacy features. if you look back in time, we’ve added some every year. it is not aimed at a company. it’s aimed at a principle. and the principle is that the individual should be in control over whether they’re tracked or not, who has their data. it’s that simple. and if you were designing such a system from scratch today, of course you would do this. of course, it should be your decision of what happens to your data, not mine or somebody else. and people that argue against that choice is essentially saying that they didn’t have informed consent before. and i think that’s a powerful point in and of itself.  kara swisher  right, but facebook, the company’s privacy stance, facebook said, was meant to benefit your own bottom line. and you’re in this fight with facebook. and what is your response to facebook’s response, which is quite vehement, calling you, essentially, an existential crisis to their business?  tim cook  all we’re doing, kara, is giving the user the choice whether to be tracked or not. and i think it’s hard to argue against that. i’ve been shocked that there’s been a pushback on this to —  kara swisher  really?  tim cook  — this degree. to this degree. because i mean, how do you argue against that? it’s sort of like —  kara swisher  they have a lot of them. you’re hurting small businesses. that it’s part of your bottom line.  tim cook  but we know these things are flimsy arguments.  kara swisher  so you say you’re surprised by this pushback. i’m surprised you’re surprised, i guess. you’re aiming at the heart of those businesses.  tim cook  first of all, i don’t really agree with that — with that assertion. i think that you can do digital advertising and make money from digital advertising without tracking people when they don’t know they’re being tracked. and i think time will prove that out. i’ve heard this about other things we’ve done in the past that it’s almost existential and it wasn’t. i don’t buy that.  kara swisher  what will be the result of the impact on facebook’s business, do you think? i’m going to use facebook because they’re the biggest, and they’re the ones that collect the most data. but google also does, and many others do.  tim cook  yeah, kara, i’m not focused on facebook, so i don’t know. i’m just saying —  kara swisher  but they called you their “competitor,” so you don’t see it this way? you don’t view them as a competitor to apple?  tim cook  oh, i think that we compete in some things. but no, if i may ask who our biggest competitor are, they would not be listed. we’re not in the social networking business.  kara swisher  mm-hmm. all right, let me ask you one more facebook — i’m sorry to bug you about this. but we spoke three years ago on stage in chicago. it was after cambridge analytica news broke when i asked you to imagine yourself in zuckerberg’s shoes in his situation. i want you to hear this clip. and here’s what you said.  archived recording (tim cook) we’ve always felt really responsible for — archived recording (kara swisher) mark zuckerberg — what would you do? archived recording (tim cook) what would i do? i wouldn’t be in this situation. archived recording (kara swisher) ok. [laughter]  kara swisher  people seemed to like that answer. do you feel that way now?  tim cook  you know i can only talk about the choices that apple has made.  kara swisher  mm-hmm. and this is a good choice, this transparency tracker.  tim cook  i feel very emphatically that it is. that data minimization, getting as little as you need, making sure you need what you’re getting, challenging yourself to get less and less and less and less, and then security is the underpinning for privacy, right? and encryption and there’s a whole bunch of things we could talk about there by itself.  kara swisher  well, let me ask that. several years ago, you were in a fight over encryption. this is after the 2015 san bernardino terrorist attack. the fbi asked apple to build a backdoor to unlock the attacker’s phone. you opposed the order, citing the danger to privacy.  tim cook  yes, we cited the danger to hundreds of millions of customers because you can’t build a singular backdoor. the backdoor that they were asking for was in the operating system and would affect everybody that owns an iphone.  kara swisher  and then the justice department ended up unlocking the iphone without apple’s help.  tim cook  yep.  kara swisher  where do you stand now on that?  tim cook  i think it was the right fight. i think encryption is still under fire today. there’s still people that believe that the government should have a — should either have a key or have access to a key or have a door or access to a door. and our point of view hasn’t changed on that. it’s that once you have a back door, you have a back door for everybody. there’s not a way in technology today to have a back door just for the good guys.  kara swisher  all right, you’re being sued right now by epic games, which makes the wildly popular game “fortnite.” back in august, epic tried to circumvent apple’s app store. basically, they wanted to avoid apple taking a 30% cut of the in-app purchase. so they introduced their own direct payment system. you kicked “fortnite” off the store for breaking the rules. you may not be able to talk specifically, but what was the principle at stake here?  tim cook  it’s about living up to the rules and the guidelines of the app store. and they had done that for years and then had decided evidently that they didn’t want to follow the rules anymore, and had passed something through app review and then after it had been through app review, changed it on the server side. so it was sort of a deceitful move. and so we’re going into court. we’re coming to tell our story. we’re going to talk about the privacy and security aspects of the store. and we’re confident in our case.  kara swisher  this trial is set for i think may 3, coming up.  tim cook  yeah, it’s coming in a month.  kara swisher  so when you look at this case, one of the things is, it could be bad rules. this is what they’re trying to argue, i think, on epic’s side, whether these rules where you take a certain cut and then, for example, apple takes only 15% cut of amazon’s app store revenue for prime video, for example. is there a reckoning for you all to think about changing these rules more significantly?  tim cook  well, the app store is not cast in concrete, you know? and so we’ve changed over time. and in fact, if you look at the commissions, kara, and i would sort of reframe a bit from what you said, because the vast majority of people pay nothing. because there’s not an interchange of a digital good, right? and so, like, 85% of people pay zero commission. and then with our recent move with small developers, developers earning less than a million dollars a year pay 15%. well, it turns out that that’s the vast majority of developers. and then, we also have rules that say that if you have a subscription model in the second year and later years, you only pay 15% of those. and so we’ve only reduced the price over time. it’s only gone in one direction. it’s gone down. more apps were exempted. but those rules are applied equally to everyone. so you’ve mentioned amazon getting 15%. that’s true for any kind of video streaming service that meets the guidelines of that program.  kara swisher  so it depends on what they’re doing — what they’re necessary —  tim cook  it depends on what they’re doing. right.  kara swisher  like netflix and others, right. what’s wrong with epic or any developer going their own way or allowing a direct payment system, instead of having to go through the app store? why should you have the control?  tim cook  well, i think somebody has to. i think somebody has to curate, right? because users aren’t going to come there and buy things if they don’t have trust and confidence in the store. and we think our users want that.  kara swisher  why can’t there be more stores, other stores run by others?  tim cook  because if you had side loading, you would break the privacy and security model.  kara swisher  on the phone itself, and the phone itself wouldn’t protect the user necessarily.  tim cook  well, you’d be opening up a huge vector on another store.  kara swisher  do you find this to be your most vulnerable part of your business, these issues with antitrust investigators looking into it?  tim cook  apple has helped build a economy that’s over a half a trillion dollars a year, half a trillion, and takes a very small sliver of that for the innovation that it unleashed and the expense of running the store. i think it’s hard to argue that the app store is not an economic miracle. i mean, you just look at it. there’s been over a million people in the u.s now have their livelihoods associated with the app store. and they are not only selling in the united states, but they’re selling abroad. and this is one of the fastest growing job segments.  kara swisher  . but yet, you feel you have to have complete control over this economic miracle, or you can’t envision not having control of it?  tim cook  i think curation is important as a part of the app store. in any given week, 100,000 applications come into the app review. 40,000 of them are rejected. most of them are rejected because they don’t work or don’t work like they say that they work. you can imagine if curation went away, what would occur to the app store in a very short amount of time.  kara swisher  we’ll be back in a minute. if you like this interview and want to hear others, follow us on your favorite podcast app. you’ll be able to catch up on “sway” episodes you may have missed, like my conversation with former parler ceo john matze. and you’ll get new ones delivered directly to you. more with tim cook after the break. you’ve acquired a lot of companies since 2015, but not big ones. apple has still maintained it’s not in the big acquisition game. i think the last big acquisition was beats music and beats electronics in 2014 for $3 billion, which was a long time ago. talk a little about where you think innovation is going for apple itself.  tim cook  obviously, i have a rule against talking about things in the future. but i’m very excited about ar. i’m very excited about ai.  kara swisher  what is your big interest in augmented reality? i remember we had lunch once, and again, you talked about football and augmented reality. that was all you talked about. so what was that? and i’m more interested in, as i told you, in augmented reality. what is the interest in it? because apple is holding its next worldwide developers conference in june with the tagline “glow and behold.” i don’t know what that means. it’s rumored that apple is expected to announce the first major new device since 2015, a mixed-reality headset. can you talk about ar and this mixed-reality headset?  tim cook  well, i can’t talk about anything that may or may not be in the pipeline. but in terms of ar, the promise of ar is that you and i are having a great conversation right now. arguably, it could even be better if we were able to augment our discussion with charts or other things to appear. and your audience would also benefit from this, too, i think. and so when i think about that in different fields, whether it’s health, whether it’s education, whether it’s gaming, whether it’s retail, i’m already seeing ar take off in some of these areas with use of the phone. and i think the promise is even greater in the future.  kara swisher  so it’s a critically important part of apple’s future.  tim cook  it is.  kara swisher  what about content? you’re in content. why do you think you need to be in there competing against a netflix? it seems like it’s a comma for you, like hardly any investment.  tim cook  oh, no, not at all. not at all. we’re making serious investments in apple tv plus. i assume you’re talking about video content.  kara swisher  yeah, mm-hmm.  tim cook  for the same reason that we’re in products, we’re about making the best, not the most. and so in the tv plus area, we’re about originals only on apple. and so i don’t know if you’re watching, what you’re watching at all, but —  kara swisher  “the morning show,” just on yours. that’s all.  tim cook  you’re watching “the morning show.” i hope you love it. “ted lasso” — i don’t know if you’ve watched ted lasso.  kara swisher  i have.  tim cook  but there was no better show during covid. i’m getting notes from a lot of different people that love it.  kara swisher  right, how do you compete, though, against a netflix? and you’ve got all these streamers, while hbo max is making all this content. you have money. that’s what you have the most of, i think, compared to all of them.  tim cook  well, hopefully, we have good ideas. but kara, i don’t see it as a zero sum game. i don’t see that if a given user buys netflix, that they can’t also buy apple.  kara swisher  and you think content is critical as an area of focus for apple.  tim cook  yes, and we’re putting all of ourselves into it. it is not a hobby. it is not a dip your toe in. because it’s an original focus, we don’t instantly have a catalog with 500 things in it. we’re going to build over time. we’ve gotten over 300 nominations now for awards and have won 80.  kara swisher  yeah, you don’t strike me as a hollywood guy, tim. i don’t know.  tim cook  i’m not a hollywood guy.  kara swisher  yeah, i don’t see you, like, swanning around hollywood.  tim cook  i’m not a hollywood guy. but kara, i love great content.  kara swisher  mm-hmm. last question on innovation, self-driving cars. one of the companies you acquired is drive ai, a self-driving startup. apple is testing autonomous vehicles. it was, reportedly. last year, elon musk said he offered to sell tesla to apple for 1/10 its value. and he said you wouldn’t even take a meeting with him.  tim cook  you know, i’ve never spoken to elon, although i have great admiration and respect for the company he’s built. i think tesla has done an unbelievable job of not only establishing the lead, but keeping the lead for such a long period of time in the ev space. so i have great appreciation for them. in terms of the work that we’re doing there, obviously, i’m going to be a little coy on that. the autonomy itself is a core technology, in my view. if you sort of step back, the car, in a lot of ways, is a robot. an autonomous car is a robot. and so there’s lots of things you can do with autonomy. and we’ll see what apple does. we investigate so many things internally. many of them never see the light of day. i’m not saying that one will not.  kara swisher  would it be in the form of a car or the technology within a car?  tim cook  yeah, i’m not going to answer that question.  kara swisher  i think it has to be a car. you can’t just do the tech — you’re not going to let — you’re not google.  tim cook  we love to integrate hardware, software, and services, and find the intersection points of those because we think that’s where the magic occurs. and so that’s what we love to do. and we love to own the primary technology that’s around that.  kara swisher  i’m going to go with car for that, if you don’t mind. i’m going to just jump to car. i wish you would make a car. i actually have been looking at electric cars and autonomous cars. anyway, one of the things i want to finish up is you yourself in your sort of evolution, but politically, too, you were talking about voting rights, about the issues in georgia. you did engage with trump a lot. i didn’t call you “tim apple” once. do you miss that, by the way?  tim cook  being called “tim apple“?  kara swisher  yeah.  tim cook  i changed my twitter handle to “tim apple” for a while. so i leaned into it.  kara swisher  you leaned into it. and you just didn’t correct him. you just thought, why not? why not just let him do it? how do you look at working with the biden administration versus the trump administration? because you’ve become more political, i think.  tim cook  i don’t feel political. i feel that we focus on policies. and we believe strongly in an engagement. so whoever is in the white house, we’re going to seek to engage. and we’re going to seek to find areas of commonality where we can help the administration. and there will be areas that i’m sure that we are on different sides of an issue as well. but our focus is not on the politics of it. it’s on the policy. and so that’s what we did during president trump’s administration. that’s what we’ll do during president biden’s administration.  kara swisher  talk about voting rights and what you said.  tim cook  yeah, well, voting rights, i think voting rights are fundamental to democracy. you know, i think about my old friend, john lewis. and sort of what john did to advance voting rights and the hard-fought wins there, we can’t let those go in reverse. and i think, just from a stepping back from it, i think we’re probably all having the wrong conversation on voting rights. we should be talking about using technology. how can we make it so simple that our voting participation gets to 100? or it gets really close to 100. maybe we get in the 90s or something. it’s pretty arcane.  kara swisher  certainly, but when you introduce technology into voting when it’s already fraught with accusations of fraud, it’s sort of a really troublesome stew, politically speaking.  tim cook  i’m not sure. it may answer some of the issues. it may be something that is so different than the current —  kara swisher  so voting on phones? is that what you’re talking about?  tim cook  you know, i would dream of that, because i think that’s where we live. we do our banking on phones. we have our health data on phones. we have more information on a phone about us than is in our houses. and so why not?  kara swisher  well, it’s been a little politicized at this point. i mean, it’s interesting you’re saying policy versus politics, but you’re in the middle of politics right now. are there any negatives to moving into the political space from your perspective as a modern ceo?  tim cook  it’s not something i want to do. the way that i look at it is, we want to advance some of our policies. we want to advance immigration. we want to advance on working on climate change. we want to advance job creation. we want to advance retraining because we see the need to retrain over a lifetime. and we want to find the administrations or representatives that believe in those things and work with them on those. it’s not really working against somebody. it’s working for those causes.  kara swisher  is there a cost to a ceo inserting themselves in?  tim cook  inserting themselves in policy? oh, every time i say something, somebody will reach out to me and not be very happy.  kara swisher  right, or not — or be very happy.  tim cook  yeah.  kara swisher  you decided to come out in 2014 in a bloomberg piece. i can’t believe you didn’t come to kara swisher, but that’s ok. that’s all right. i’m forgiving you. and you’re the first openly gay ceo of a fortune 500 company. do you feel the need to be an even louder voice now or a more prominent leader in this area? you just teamed up with non-profit encircle to donate a million dollars. you’re serving as honorary co-chair.  tim cook  the way that i looked at this was i wanted to speak my truth because i saw kids struggling with who they were and maybe being disowned by their families, maybe being bullied — a set of horribles, if you will. and i felt that coming out and speaking my truth would help show them that there was a light at the end of the tunnel; that they could rise and do things incredible in life, that they were not capped in some kind of way because they were part of the lgbtq community. and i feel like — well, i know because i’ve gotten so many different notes and people reaching out to me over time — that i accomplished that for a number of people. and i feel really good about that. i don’t feel like that’s all i need to do. i think to whom much is given, much is required. and so i’m going to continue. encircle is a great example. i don’t know if you’re familiar with that organization.  kara swisher  i am. they build homes.  tim cook  but they build homes. they have kids that come to these homes. they have programs built around. it’s a safe place to be. i think that program is scalable. and so we want to help that in any way that we can. and i’m going to speak out on laws and regulations that pop up that are discriminatory to the community.  kara swisher  what about arkansas? arkansas has passed a bill allowing doctors to refuse to treat lgbtq patients. how do you look at issues like this?  tim cook  this is, everybody should be treated with dignity and respect. if you go in to a doctor, they should treat you. i’m surprised we’re even having to say that. it’s disappointing.  kara swisher  yeah. are you worried?  tim cook  i’m worried that there seems to be more of a move afoot in a number of states in this front, uh, very focused on transgender and then some focused on the broader community. and i think this encroachment needs to stop.  kara swisher  all right, so 10 years. are you going to be at apple 10 more years?  tim cook  10 more years, i probably not. but i can tell you that i feel great right now. and the date’s not in sight. but 10 more years is a long time and probably not 10 more years.  kara swisher  what would you do if you weren’t running apple?  tim cook  i don’t have a clue, because i love this company so much, that it’s hard to imagine my life without it.  kara swisher  right.  tim cook  and so i don’t think i will know that until after i’m not here. because i think i’ll run so fast that i’ll never really think about it until i’m not running anymore. does that make any sense?  kara swisher  maybe just go on vacation.  tim cook  [laughs]  kara swisher  something like that. all right, tim, thank you so much.  tim cook  kara, it was great talking with you. good seeing you.  kara swisher  all right, bye.  tim cook  bye-bye.

2021-04-05 22:00:18,"should wall street be right about fiscal second quarter, apple will deliver growth not seen in many years. here is what sell-side analysts have been saying about the cupertino company’s march results.  first period 2021 earnings season for us-based companies unofficially starts in mid-april. the iphone maker has not yet scheduled its fiscal second quarter earnings date, but it is likely that it will take place between april 27th and april 29th.  wall street has started to weigh in on how they believe apple will perform in the january-to-march quarter. below is a summary of sell-side expectations, along with analysts’ consensus opinion on apple stock.  strong growth expected  among the 30 wall street experts tracked by stock rover, consensus expectation is for revenues in the march quarter to grow by an impressive 32% year-over-year (see first table below). should the estimate be met, this will be apple’s best quarter of sales in at least five years, if not much longer.  the robust top-line results would be achieved, in part, due to easy comps. fiscal second quarter of 2020 was marked by the early stages of the covid-19 crisis, when the first lockdowns caused apple stores to close in the us and abroad, and consumers pulled back on spending. in the march 2020 period, apple’s revenues increased by less than 1%.  aapl - revenue estimate details. stock rover  but because apple did not provide guidance for fiscal second quarter 2021, due to pandemic uncertainties, analyst estimates have been all over the place. for example, the most optimistic expert sees revenues growing 43%. the least optimistic believes in a much tamer 21% increase.  on the bottom line, apple’s earnings per share is projected to land just short of $1. if achieved, the eps increase over fiscal 2020 levels would be a very respectable 53%. earnings that grow faster than revenues largely suggest some margin expansion and share retirement as well.  aapl - earnings estimate details. stock rover  wall street on apple stock  looking more broadly at recommendations and share price targets, wall street continues to have a very bullish view on apple stock. see charts below.  the great majority of analysts sees apple stock as a strong buy. the consensus price target is roughly $150 per share, which suggests nearly 20% upside to current levels. following two years of 80%-plus returns, another round of double-digit gains would not be bad at all.  aapl - consensus analyst rating. stock rover  twitter speaks  judging by the consensus opinion, sell-side shops seem excited about apple stock in general, and about the company’s fiscal second period results more specifically. however, could analysts be painting an overly rosy picture of apple’s post-holiday quarter? or will apple meet the expectations?  i asked twitter for some help on these questions.  explore more data and graphs  the data used in this report was provided by stock rover. i have been impressed with the breadth and depth of information on markets, stocks and etfs that this platform provides. stock rover also helps to set up detailed filters, track custom portfolios and measure their performance relative to a number of benchmarks.  to learn more, check out stockrover.com and get started for as low as $7.99 a month. the premium plus plan that i have will give you access to all the information that went into my analysis and much more.

2021-04-05 18:42:32,"tim cook has been with apple inc. for 23 years and served as its chief executive officer for nearly a decade, but he used a new podcast appearance to suggest that some kind of an eventual change may be on the horizon.  “i feel great right now. and the date’s not in sight,” the 60-year-old told the new york times “sway” podcast that was released monday. “but 10 more years is a long time and probably not 10 more years.”  the interview touched on a wide range of topics including the controversial parler social media app that was blocked by apple earlier this year, apple tv+ and autonomous vehicles. cook, when asked about elon musk’s claim that he once tried to hold talks about the possibility of selling tesla to apple, said that he’s never spoken with musk but that he has “great admiration and respect” for the company he built.  “i think tesla has done an unbelievable job of not only establishing the lead, but keeping the lead for such a long period of time in the ev space,” cook said without revealing many clues about what apple had planned for the sector. “we’ll see what apple does. we investigate so many things internally. many of them never see the light of day. i’m not saying that one will not.”  other topics covered include:  on removing parler from the app store: “in some ways, it was a straightforward decision, because they were not adhering to the guidelines of the app store. you can’t be inciting violence or allow people to incite violence. you can’t allow hate speech and so forth. and they had moved from moderating to not being able to moderate.” “i hope that they come back on. because we work hard to get people on the store, not to keep people off the store. and so, i’m hoping that they put in the moderation that’s required to be on the store and come back, because i think having more social networks out there is better than having less.”    on social media and the attack on the capitol: “i think that the amplification of social media is something that i deeply worry about. and the targeting tools, the same tools that are used to target in advertising can be used to target for misinformation purposes or extremist purposes. and so i deeply worry about that.” “this was one of the darkest days in our history. and it played out in front of all of us. i felt like it was more of a movie or something, that it was something that was not real, that it couldn’t be happening in the united states of america. and so i’m hopeful that that deep inspection occurs.”    on “data thievery”: “i’m appalled by it. and so we’ve got things coming out like a privacy nutrition label. privacy policies have become these multi-page things that people just blindly say, i agree, so that they can go to the next screen and move on. a privacy nutrition label, much like a nutrition label on food, gives you at a glance some key information. we’ll improve that over time.”    on epic games: “it’s about living up to the rules and the guidelines of the app store. and they had done that for years and then had decided evidently that they didn’t want to follow the rules anymore, and had passed something through app review and then after it had been through app review, changed it on the server side. so it was sort of a deceitful move. and so we’re going into court. we’re coming to tell our story. we’re going to talk about the privacy and security aspects of the store. and we’re confident in our case.”    on apple tv+: “we’re making serious investments in apple tv plus.” “for the same reason that we’re in products, we’re about making the best, not the most. and so in the tv plus area, we’re about originals only on apple.” “we’re putting all of ourselves into it. it is not a hobby. it is not a dip your toe in. because it’s an original focus, we don’t instantly have a catalog with 500 things in it. we’re going to build over time.”  "
2021-04-05 18:15:15,"apple ceo tim cook rarely provides details on unannounced products, but he offered some hints about apple’s thinking on augmented reality and cars in an interview with kara swisher for the new york times this morning.  when it comes to augmented reality, he agreed with swisher’s framing that the tech is “critically important” to apple’s future and said it could be used to enhance conversations.  “you and i are having a great conversation right now. arguably, it could even be better if we were able to augment our discussion with charts or other things to appear,” cook said. he imagines ar being used in health, education, retail, and gaming. “i’m already seeing ar take off in some of these areas with use of the phone. and i think the promise is even greater in the future.”  “you know, i’ve never spoken to elon.”  apple has been rumored for years to be working on an augmented reality headset, and the latest leaks suggested a mixed reality device could launch next year. augmented reality features are already available on the iphone and ipad, but outside of some fun snapchat filters, augmented reality hasn’t become all that widely used yet.  cook also talked broadly about apple’s approach to products during a question about cars. leaks from apple have made it unclear if the company is developing self-driving tech that it could license to other companies or if apple plans to develop an entire car by itself. cook’s latest comments suggest the latter, assuming the project comes to fruition.  “we love to integrate hardware, software, and services, and find the intersection points of those because we think that’s where the magic occurs,” cook said. “and so that’s what we love to do. and we love to own the primary technology that’s around that.”  cook referred to “autonomy” as a “core technology” and said there are “lots of things you can do” with it in connection with robots. but he warned that not every apple project eventually ships. “we investigate so many things internally. many of them never see the light of day,” cook said. “i’m not saying that one will not.”  swisher also asked cook about elon musk’s comments about a failed attempt to discuss selling tesla to apple around 2017. “you know, i’ve never spoken to elon,” cook said, “although i have great admiration and respect for the company he’s built.”"

2021-04-05 14:35:44,"archived recording (singing) when you walk in the room, do you have sway? [music playing]  kara swisher  i’m kara swisher, and you’re listening to “sway.” my guest today is apple ceo tim cook. he’s been at apple for 23 years and at the helm of the company for almost 10, having inherited the reins from the late steve jobs. when cook got the top job, apple’s market cap was close to $350 billion. today, it’s worth over $2 trillion. it churns out billions of devices that are hugely popular worldwide, but the company is also now in the crosshairs of antitrust investigators due to its massive size and power. epic games is suing apple, for example, alleging the company is a monopoly. and other developers are also complaining to regulators. meanwhile, some users of the so-called free speech network parler have also taken issue with apple for removing parler from its app store. it was a move made by apple and by google and amazon after the capitol attacks. they maintain that parler failed to moderate dangerous content related to the attempted insurrection on january 6. cook has also become a hero to some, doubling down in an impassioned speech and a major privacy conference recently, calling out the tech industry, especially social media companies, over misuse of consumer data.  archived recording (tim cook) if a business is built on misleading users on data exploitation, on choices that are no choices at all, then it does not deserve our praise. it deserves reform. we should not look away from the bigger picture. at a moment of rampant disinformation and conspiracy theories juiced by algorithms, we can no longer turn a blind eye to a theory of technology that says all engagement is good engagement.  kara swisher  tim cook, welcome to “sway.” that was quite a speech. i was surprised by how strongly you put it. you were talking about social media companies there and those that use data. you took parler off. how did you think about that decision?  tim cook  well, in some ways, it was a straightforward decision, because they were not adhering to the guidelines of the app store. you can’t be inciting violence or allow people to incite violence. you can’t allow hate speech and so forth. and they had moved from moderating to not being able to moderate. but we gave them a chance to cure that. and they were unable to do that or didn’t do that. and so we had to pull them off. now, having said that, kara, i hope that they come back on. because we work hard to get people on the store, not to keep people off the store. and so, i’m hoping that they put in the moderation that’s required to be on the store and come back, because i think having more social networks out there is better than having less.  kara swisher  the day of the attack, i was actually interviewing the c.e.o of parler. it was quite an astonishing interview. did you listen to what he said? he said, i don’t have responsibility. i don’t take any responsibility.  tim cook  and obviously, that doesn’t adhere to the app store terms and conditions.  kara swisher  yeah, you had been working with them previously on these issues, too.  tim cook  we believe that at a point in time, they were compliant.  kara swisher  and then they were not.  tim cook  and then they were not.  kara swisher  yeah, and lots of tech companies acted at the same time, whether it was amazon, google, you, and others. it was sort of like a house of cards sort of fell in on them. should it have been done before?  tim cook  it happened as soon as we became aware of it. and i’m not sure it would have taken the capitol event for that to occur. we would have taken it off when we became aware. after giving some time to cure, we would have taken it off. and again, i can’t stress enough, i hope they come back.  kara swisher  yeah, i want to talk about the hearings on capitol hill last month. you weren’t there, but the ceos of three tech companies were — mark zuckerberg of facebook, jack dorsey of twitter, and sundar pichai from google and alphabet. congressman mike doyle asked all three tech executives to answer yes or no to the same question, which was a little reductive. i would have asked it slightly differently. but he wanted to know whether their companies bore any responsibility for spreading misinformation and planning the attack on the capitol. they didn’t answer. they sort of tried to walk around it. jack dorsey kind of answered — said yes, but, essentially. how would you have answered for those companies or for apple, or technology in general?  tim cook  well, i can only speak for apple. and from the very start, we’ve always believed in curation. and so we review every app that goes on the store. that doesn’t mean that we’re perfect at doing it. we’re not. but we care deeply about what we’re offering our users. and when we have a news product like apple news, we have human editors that are selecting the key stories. and so, they’re avoiding all of the misinformation that is out there. the reality is that the web in some areas has become a dark place. and without curation, you wind up with this firehose of things that i would not want to put into an amplifier.  kara swisher  right.  tim cook  which is what tech is, in a large way. if you have a platform, you amplify things.  kara swisher  do you consider apple an amplifier?  tim cook  well, i think in areas like the selection of stories on apple news, we have human editors do that. even though the app store isn’t a push, so we’re not pushing things in your feed like a social media company would be, a lot of people are coming to the app store. and so we want that to be a safe and trusted place to be.  kara swisher  what is the broader culpability of big tech in the context of things like the attack? because you did actually address it in your speech on privacy. a lot of people give some culpability to social media sites. and apple does not have one. ping never sort of took off. i remember ping was the social network apple had that —  tim cook  yeah, i do remember. i’m glad you reminded me.  kara swisher  yeah, i remember steve. he says, what do you think of ping? it sucks. and he’s like, yes, yeah, it does. it really does. but do you think social media sites were culpable in the attack?  tim cook  i think that the amplification of social media is something that i deeply worry about. and the targeting tools, the same tools that are used to target in advertising can be used to target for misinformation purposes or extremist purposes. and so i deeply worry about that. the people i fault the most for the capitol attack are the people that obviously were in the attack itself, that breached the capitol. but i think it’s incumbent on all of us to take a step back and ask, what were the other contributing factors? because we don’t want to repeat it. this was one of the darkest days in our history. and it played out in front of all of us. i felt like it was more of a movie or something, that it was something that was not real, that it couldn’t be happening in the united states of america. and so i’m hopeful that that deep inspection occurs.  kara swisher  so one of the things this calls for amending section 230, which is, of course, the part of the communications decency act that protects platforms from getting sued because of content of the user’s post. do you think liability is important?  tim cook  i’m not big on suing as a lever. i think 230, it was written at a time prior to lots of things that have come into existence. and they weren’t envisioned. and so, i think it’s time to revisit 230. but i don’t have an answer of what the perfect way to revise 230 would be.  kara swisher  so let’s talk about the solutions. i want to get into privacy, which apple has been pushing rather hard as well. how do you look at data and privacy bills that are being contemplated?  tim cook  generally speaking, i think privacy is one of the top issues of the 21st century. and i think we’re in a crisis.  kara swisher  ok.  tim cook  years ago, i thought companies would regulate themselves and sort of get better. i no longer believe that. and i’m not generally somebody that is keen on regulation, but i think that regulation is required.  kara swisher  what made you not believe it? what tipped you over?  tim cook  because i saw companies continually going outside of what i thought were reasonable rails.  kara swisher  mm-hmm. one of the things you said in that speech, if we accept as normal and unavoidable that everything in our lives can be aggregated and sold, we lose so much more than data. we lose freedom to be human. talk about what you meant by that.  tim cook  if you think about a surveillance world, a world where you know somebody is always watching everything you’re doing — and in the case of a phone or a computer, it’s also what you’re thinking, because you’re typing in searches and so on and so forth. and so i think in that kind of world, you begin to do less. you begin to think less. your freedom of expression begins to narrow. and the walls move in on you. and i start thinking about that at its natural endpoint. and i don’t want to be a part of that society.  kara swisher  and why is it important for apple to speak up on this? you sell the phones that allow these apps to do those things. you’ve used it as a brand attribute in advertising, very strong advertising standing up for privacy. why are you speaking out so strongly about it?  tim cook  it’s not about being a brand attribute, to be frank. for us, privacy is a basic human right. and it’s a right that other rights are built off of. it’s that kind of core. it’s bedrock. and it’s not something that i just decided a few years ago. as i remember, steve commented on this with you over a decade ago. he said something like, privacy means people know what they’re signing up for in plain english, repeatedly. the individual should own their data. and they should own the ability to say who gets it and what of their data they get and what they use it for. and frankly, that’s not the situation of today.  kara swisher  are you surprised by the amount of data thievery, essentially, that goes on?  tim cook  i’m appalled by it. and so we’ve got things coming out like a privacy nutrition label. privacy policies have become these multi-page things that people just blindly say, i agree, so that they can go to the next screen and move on. a privacy nutrition label, much like a nutrition label on food, gives you at a glance some key information. we’ll improve that over time. and then the one, kara, that’s probably gotten the most attention is called att.  kara swisher  yes, we’re going to get into that.  tim cook  app tracking transparency, and what it tries to get at is companies that are taking advantage of tracking you across apps of other companies, and therefore putting together an entire profile of what you’re thinking, what you’re doing, surveilling you across the web 24/7.  kara swisher  right, using devices you make as the vehicle to do so.  tim cook  they are using all technology for these, whether —  kara swisher  yeah, right. i’m just saying in your case. so let’s make it easy for people to understand. when exactly is the new update coming out?  tim cook  it’s just a few weeks now.  kara swisher  all right, and it’s called att, which is app tracking transparency.  tim cook  that’s right.  kara swisher  obviously, companies like facebook and many others make a lot of money from data collected from those trackers. how will the consumers see it? what is going to happen?  tim cook  they’ll see a simple pop-up that basically prompts them to answer the question of, are they ok with being tracked or not? if they are, things move on. if they’re not, then the tracking is turned off for that individual with respect to that specific app.  kara swisher  right, and will it tell them what’s tracking to let them make a decision? because just saying, do you want to be tracked, most people are like, stopped? no, no thank you.  tim cook  the developer can put essentially other information in there. maybe they say that it’s for better ads or better targeted ads or whatever. all we want to do is supply a tool so that the person that should make the decision can make it.  kara swisher  you’re guiding them there, though. you are guiding them to doing this. why did you decide to do this now?  tim cook  kara, every year, we add privacy features. if you look back in time, we’ve added some every year. it is not aimed at a company. it’s aimed at a principle. and the principle is that the individual should be in control over whether they’re tracked or not, who has their data. it’s that simple. and if you were designing such a system from scratch today, of course you would do this. of course, it should be your decision of what happens to your data, not mine or somebody else. and people that argue against that choice is essentially saying that they didn’t have informed consent before. and i think that’s a powerful point in and of itself.  kara swisher  right, but facebook, the company’s privacy stance, facebook said, was meant to benefit your own bottom line. and you’re in this fight with facebook. and what is your response to facebook’s response, which is quite vehement, calling you, essentially, an existential crisis to their business?  tim cook  all we’re doing, kara, is giving the user the choice whether to be tracked or not. and i think it’s hard to argue against that. i’ve been shocked that there’s been a pushback on this to —  kara swisher  really?  tim cook  — this degree. to this degree. because i mean, how do you argue against that? it’s sort of like —  kara swisher  they have a lot of them. you’re hurting small businesses. that it’s part of your bottom line.  tim cook  but we know these things are flimsy arguments.  kara swisher  so you say you’re surprised by this pushback. i’m surprised you’re surprised, i guess. you’re aiming at the heart of those businesses.  tim cook  first of all, i don’t really agree with that — with that assertion. i think that you can do digital advertising and make money from digital advertising without tracking people when they don’t know they’re being tracked. and i think time will prove that out. i’ve heard this about other things we’ve done in the past that it’s almost existential and it wasn’t. i don’t buy that.  kara swisher  what will be the result of the impact on facebook’s business, do you think? i’m going to use facebook because they’re the biggest, and they’re the ones that collect the most data. but google also does, and many others do.  tim cook  yeah, kara, i’m not focused on facebook, so i don’t know. i’m just saying —  kara swisher  but they called you their “competitor,” so you don’t see it this way? you don’t view them as a competitor to apple?  tim cook  oh, i think that we compete in some things. but no, if i may ask who our biggest competitor are, they would not be listed. we’re not in the social networking business.  kara swisher  mm-hmm. all right, let me ask you one more facebook — i’m sorry to bug you about this. but we spoke three years ago on stage in chicago. it was after cambridge analytica news broke when i asked you to imagine yourself in zuckerberg’s shoes in his situation. i want you to hear this clip. and here’s what you said.  archived recording (tim cook) we’ve always felt really responsible for — archived recording (kara swisher) mark zuckerberg — what would you do? archived recording (tim cook) what would i do? i wouldn’t be in this situation. archived recording (kara swisher) ok. [laughter]  kara swisher  people seemed to like that answer. do you feel that way now?  tim cook  you know i can only talk about the choices that apple has made.  kara swisher  mm-hmm. and this is a good choice, this transparency tracker.  tim cook  i feel very emphatically that it is. that data minimization, getting as little as you need, making sure you need what you’re getting, challenging yourself to get less and less and less and less, and then security is the underpinning for privacy, right? and encryption and there’s a whole bunch of things we could talk about there by itself.  kara swisher  well, let me ask that. several years ago, you were in a fight over encryption. this is after the 2015 san bernardino terrorist attack. the fbi asked apple to build a backdoor to unlock the attacker’s phone. you opposed the order, citing the danger to privacy.  tim cook  yes, we cited the danger to hundreds of millions of customers because you can’t build a singular backdoor. the backdoor that they were asking for was in the operating system and would affect everybody that owns an iphone.  kara swisher  and then the justice department ended up unlocking the iphone without apple’s help.  tim cook  yep.  kara swisher  where do you stand now on that?  tim cook  i think it was the right fight. i think encryption is still under fire today. there’s still people that believe that the government should have a — should either have a key or have access to a key or have a door or access to a door. and our point of view hasn’t changed on that. it’s that once you have a back door, you have a back door for everybody. there’s not a way in technology today to have a back door just for the good guys.  kara swisher  all right, you’re being sued right now by epic games, which makes the wildly popular game “fortnite.” back in august, epic tried to circumvent apple’s app store. basically, they wanted to avoid apple taking a 30% cut of the in-app purchase. so they introduced their own direct payment system. you kicked “fortnite” off the store for breaking the rules. you may not be able to talk specifically, but what was the principle at stake here?  tim cook  it’s about living up to the rules and the guidelines of the app store. and they had done that for years and then had decided evidently that they didn’t want to follow the rules anymore, and had passed something through app review and then after it had been through app review, changed it on the server side. so it was sort of a deceitful move. and so we’re going into court. we’re coming to tell our story. we’re going to talk about the privacy and security aspects of the store. and we’re confident in our case.  kara swisher  this trial is set for i think may 3, coming up.  tim cook  yeah, it’s coming in a month.  kara swisher  so when you look at this case, one of the things is, it could be bad rules. this is what they’re trying to argue, i think, on epic’s side, whether these rules where you take a certain cut and then, for example, apple takes only 15% cut of amazon’s app store revenue for prime video, for example. is there a reckoning for you all to think about changing these rules more significantly?  tim cook  well, the app store is not cast in concrete, you know? and so we’ve changed over time. and in fact, if you look at the commissions, kara, and i would sort of reframe a bit from what you said, because the vast majority of people pay nothing. because there’s not an interchange of a digital good, right? and so, like, 85% of people pay zero commission. and then with our recent move with small developers, developers earning less than a million dollars a year pay 15%. well, it turns out that that’s the vast majority of developers. and then, we also have rules that say that if you have a subscription model in the second year and later years, you only pay 15% of those. and so we’ve only reduced the price over time. it’s only gone in one direction. it’s gone down. more apps were exempted. but those rules are applied equally to everyone. so you’ve mentioned amazon getting 15%. that’s true for any kind of video streaming service that meets the guidelines of that program.  kara swisher  so it depends on what they’re doing — what they’re necessary —  tim cook  it depends on what they’re doing. right.  kara swisher  like netflix and others, right. what’s wrong with epic or any developer going their own way or allowing a direct payment system, instead of having to go through the app store? why should you have the control?  tim cook  well, i think somebody has to. i think somebody has to curate, right? because users aren’t going to come there and buy things if they don’t have trust and confidence in the store. and we think our users want that.  kara swisher  why can’t there be more stores, other stores run by others?  tim cook  because if you had side loading, you would break the privacy and security model.  kara swisher  on the phone itself, and the phone itself wouldn’t protect the user necessarily.  tim cook  well, you’d be opening up a huge vector on another store.  kara swisher  do you find this to be your most vulnerable part of your business, these issues with antitrust investigators looking into it?  tim cook  apple has helped build a economy that’s over a half a trillion dollars a year, half a trillion, and takes a very small sliver of that for the innovation that it unleashed and the expense of running the store. i think it’s hard to argue that the app store is not an economic miracle. i mean, you just look at it. there’s been over a million people in the u.s now have their livelihoods associated with the app store. and they are not only selling in the united states, but they’re selling abroad. and this is one of the fastest growing job segments.  kara swisher  . but yet, you feel you have to have complete control over this economic miracle, or you can’t envision not having control of it?  tim cook  i think curation is important as a part of the app store. in any given week, 100,000 applications come into the app review. 40,000 of them are rejected. most of them are rejected because they don’t work or don’t work like they say that they work. you can imagine if curation went away, what would occur to the app store in a very short amount of time.  kara swisher  we’ll be back in a minute. if you like this interview and want to hear others, follow us on your favorite podcast app. you’ll be able to catch up on “sway” episodes you may have missed, like my conversation with former parler ceo john matze. and you’ll get new ones delivered directly to you. more with tim cook after the break. you’ve acquired a lot of companies since 2015, but not big ones. apple has still maintained it’s not in the big acquisition game. i think the last big acquisition was beats music and beats electronics in 2014 for $3 billion, which was a long time ago. talk a little about where you think innovation is going for apple itself.  tim cook  obviously, i have a rule against talking about things in the future. but i’m very excited about ar. i’m very excited about ai.  kara swisher  what is your big interest in augmented reality? i remember we had lunch once, and again, you talked about football and augmented reality. that was all you talked about. so what was that? and i’m more interested in, as i told you, in augmented reality. what is the interest in it? because apple is holding its next worldwide developers conference in june with the tagline “glow and behold.” i don’t know what that means. it’s rumored that apple is expected to announce the first major new device since 2015, a mixed-reality headset. can you talk about ar and this mixed-reality headset?  tim cook  well, i can’t talk about anything that may or may not be in the pipeline. but in terms of ar, the promise of ar is that you and i are having a great conversation right now. arguably, it could even be better if we were able to augment our discussion with charts or other things to appear. and your audience would also benefit from this, too, i think. and so when i think about that in different fields, whether it’s health, whether it’s education, whether it’s gaming, whether it’s retail, i’m already seeing ar take off in some of these areas with use of the phone. and i think the promise is even greater in the future.  kara swisher  so it’s a critically important part of apple’s future.  tim cook  it is.  kara swisher  what about content? you’re in content. why do you think you need to be in there competing against a netflix? it seems like it’s a comma for you, like hardly any investment.  tim cook  oh, no, not at all. not at all. we’re making serious investments in apple tv plus. i assume you’re talking about video content.  kara swisher  yeah, mm-hmm.  tim cook  for the same reason that we’re in products, we’re about making the best, not the most. and so in the tv plus area, we’re about originals only on apple. and so i don’t know if you’re watching, what you’re watching at all, but —  kara swisher  “the morning show,” just on yours. that’s all.  tim cook  you’re watching “the morning show.” i hope you love it. “ted lasso” — i don’t know if you’ve watched ted lasso.  kara swisher  i have.  tim cook  but there was no better show during covid. i’m getting notes from a lot of different people that love it.  kara swisher  right, how do you compete, though, against a netflix? and you’ve got all these streamers, while hbo max is making all this content. you have money. that’s what you have the most of, i think, compared to all of them.  tim cook  well, hopefully, we have good ideas. but kara, i don’t see it as a zero sum game. i don’t see that if a given user buys netflix, that they can’t also buy apple.  kara swisher  and you think content is critical as an area of focus for apple.  tim cook  yes, and we’re putting all of ourselves into it. it is not a hobby. it is not a dip your toe in. because it’s an original focus, we don’t instantly have a catalog with 500 things in it. we’re going to build over time. we’ve gotten over 300 nominations now for awards and have won 80.  kara swisher  yeah, you don’t strike me as a hollywood guy, tim. i don’t know.  tim cook  i’m not a hollywood guy.  kara swisher  yeah, i don’t see you, like, swanning around hollywood.  tim cook  i’m not a hollywood guy. but kara, i love great content.  kara swisher  mm-hmm. last question on innovation, self-driving cars. one of the companies you acquired is drive ai, a self-driving startup. apple is testing autonomous vehicles. it was, reportedly. last year, elon musk said he offered to sell tesla to apple for 1/10 its value. and he said you wouldn’t even take a meeting with him.  tim cook  you know, i’ve never spoken to elon, although i have great admiration and respect for the company he’s built. i think tesla has done an unbelievable job of not only establishing the lead, but keeping the lead for such a long period of time in the ev space. so i have great appreciation for them. in terms of the work that we’re doing there, obviously, i’m going to be a little coy on that. the autonomy itself is a core technology, in my view. if you sort of step back, the car, in a lot of ways, is a robot. an autonomous car is a robot. and so there’s lots of things you can do with autonomy. and we’ll see what apple does. we investigate so many things internally. many of them never see the light of day. i’m not saying that one will not.  kara swisher  would it be in the form of a car or the technology within a car?  tim cook  yeah, i’m not going to answer that question.  kara swisher  i think it has to be a car. you can’t just do the tech — you’re not going to let — you’re not google.  tim cook  we love to integrate hardware, software, and services, and find the intersection points of those because we think that’s where the magic occurs. and so that’s what we love to do. and we love to own the primary technology that’s around that.  kara swisher  i’m going to go with car for that, if you don’t mind. i’m going to just jump to car. i wish you would make a car. i actually have been looking at electric cars and autonomous cars. anyway, one of the things i want to finish up is you yourself in your sort of evolution, but politically, too, you were talking about voting rights, about the issues in georgia. you did engage with trump a lot. i didn’t call you “tim apple” once. do you miss that, by the way?  tim cook  being called “tim apple“?  kara swisher  yeah.  tim cook  i changed my twitter handle to “tim apple” for a while. so i leaned into it.  kara swisher  you leaned into it. and you just didn’t correct him. you just thought, why not? why not just let him do it? how do you look at working with the biden administration versus the trump administration? because you’ve become more political, i think.  tim cook  i don’t feel political. i feel that we focus on policies. and we believe strongly in an engagement. so whoever is in the white house, we’re going to seek to engage. and we’re going to seek to find areas of commonality where we can help the administration. and there will be areas that i’m sure that we are on different sides of an issue as well. but our focus is not on the politics of it. it’s on the policy. and so that’s what we did during president trump’s administration. that’s what we’ll do during president biden’s administration.  kara swisher  talk about voting rights and what you said.  tim cook  yeah, well, voting rights, i think voting rights are fundamental to democracy. you know, i think about my old friend, john lewis. and sort of what john did to advance voting rights and the hard-fought wins there, we can’t let those go in reverse. and i think, just from a stepping back from it, i think we’re probably all having the wrong conversation on voting rights. we should be talking about using technology. how can we make it so simple that our voting participation gets to 100? or it gets really close to 100. maybe we get in the 90s or something. it’s pretty arcane.  kara swisher  certainly, but when you introduce technology into voting when it’s already fraught with accusations of fraud, it’s sort of a really troublesome stew, politically speaking.  tim cook  i’m not sure. it may answer some of the issues. it may be something that is so different than the current —  kara swisher  so voting on phones? is that what you’re talking about?  tim cook  you know, i would dream of that, because i think that’s where we live. we do our banking on phones. we have our health data on phones. we have more information on a phone about us than is in our houses. and so why not?  kara swisher  well, it’s been a little politicized at this point. i mean, it’s interesting you’re saying policy versus politics, but you’re in the middle of politics right now. are there any negatives to moving into the political space from your perspective as a modern ceo?  tim cook  it’s not something i want to do. the way that i look at it is, we want to advance some of our policies. we want to advance immigration. we want to advance on working on climate change. we want to advance job creation. we want to advance retraining because we see the need to retrain over a lifetime. and we want to find the administrations or representatives that believe in those things and work with them on those. it’s not really working against somebody. it’s working for those causes.  kara swisher  is there a cost to a ceo inserting themselves in?  tim cook  inserting themselves in policy? oh, every time i say something, somebody will reach out to me and not be very happy.  kara swisher  right, or not — or be very happy.  tim cook  yeah.  kara swisher  you decided to come out in 2014 in a bloomberg piece. i can’t believe you didn’t come to kara swisher, but that’s ok. that’s all right. i’m forgiving you. and you’re the first openly gay ceo of a fortune 500 company. do you feel the need to be an even louder voice now or a more prominent leader in this area? you just teamed up with non-profit encircle to donate a million dollars. you’re serving as honorary co-chair.  tim cook  the way that i looked at this was i wanted to speak my truth because i saw kids struggling with who they were and maybe being disowned by their families, maybe being bullied — a set of horribles, if you will. and i felt that coming out and speaking my truth would help show them that there was a light at the end of the tunnel; that they could rise and do things incredible in life, that they were not capped in some kind of way because they were part of the lgbtq community. and i feel like — well, i know because i’ve gotten so many different notes and people reaching out to me over time — that i accomplished that for a number of people. and i feel really good about that. i don’t feel like that’s all i need to do. i think to whom much is given, much is required. and so i’m going to continue. encircle is a great example. i don’t know if you’re familiar with that organization.  kara swisher  i am. they build homes.  tim cook  but they build homes. they have kids that come to these homes. they have programs built around. it’s a safe place to be. i think that program is scalable. and so we want to help that in any way that we can. and i’m going to speak out on laws and regulations that pop up that are discriminatory to the community.  kara swisher  what about arkansas? arkansas has passed a bill allowing doctors to refuse to treat lgbtq patients. how do you look at issues like this?  tim cook  this is, everybody should be treated with dignity and respect. if you go in to a doctor, they should treat you. i’m surprised we’re even having to say that. it’s disappointing.  kara swisher  yeah. are you worried?  tim cook  i’m worried that there seems to be more of a move afoot in a number of states in this front, uh, very focused on transgender and then some focused on the broader community. and i think this encroachment needs to stop.  kara swisher  all right, so 10 years. are you going to be at apple 10 more years?  tim cook  10 more years, i probably not. but i can tell you that i feel great right now. and the date’s not in sight. but 10 more years is a long time and probably not 10 more years.  kara swisher  what would you do if you weren’t running apple?  tim cook  i don’t have a clue, because i love this company so much, that it’s hard to imagine my life without it.  kara swisher  right.  tim cook  and so i don’t think i will know that until after i’m not here. because i think i’ll run so fast that i’ll never really think about it until i’m not running anymore. does that make any sense?  kara swisher  maybe just go on vacation.  tim cook  [laughs]  kara swisher  something like that. all right, tim, thank you so much.  tim cook  kara, it was great talking with you. good seeing you.  kara swisher  all right, bye.  tim cook  bye-bye. [music playing]  kara swisher"
2021-04-05 14:34:37,"apple stock is poised to sink by more than 30%. at least this is what one wall street analyst has been saying. the apple maven analyzes the bearish case and the key driver of potential share price decline.  on the very first day of the new quarter, one wall street analyst sounded the alarm on apple stock. according to goldman sachs’ rod hall, there is “significant downside risk” to investing in shares of the cupertino company at current levels.  at the core of the analyst’s fears is apple’s services segment. today, the apple maven looks closer at the argument, and assesses the merit of the bearish call.  figure 1: app store icon and apps icon. apple  drop off in services  goldman sachs defends the idea that apple is worth only $83 per share, which represents more than 30% downside risk. one of the factors that could lead the stock lower is worse-than-expected service revenues in 2022. below is the analyst’s quote:  “we believe there is significant downside risk to cy’22 consensus for services revenue driven primarily by a slowdown in app store growth post covid. we also flag the possibility of a drop off in apple tv+ revenue if apple were to end the one-year free trial on the purchase of new devices though we are now assuming continuation of the free trial in our forecasts.""  based on the above, there are two key pieces to the services puzzle. first, the research shop sees post-pandemic headwinds that would likely be caused by a return to normal: from staying at home trends to “get outside” habits.  i think it is not hard to understand the logic here. will consumers be as compelled to sign up for services like apple arcade, for example, if the alternative is to seek other forms of entertainment offscreen, which were largely not available in 2020 and parts of 2021?  regarding the app store, i could even add another risk. epic games and other tech companies, in addition to governments around the world, have been targeting apple for its position as a powerful gatekeeper of the app ecosystem.  under pressure, the cupertino company could be tempted to lower its commissions even further – although, for now, the impact of doing so has been minimal.  the second piece pertains to apple tv+ more specifically. the company used an aggressive marketing strategy last year by offering one free year of the service to buyers of new apple devices. as the trial period expires in july 2021, goldman sachs seems to believe that renewal rates could be lower than currently projected.  once again, regardless of whether it will prove right or wrong, the thesis has some merit. the streaming video space has become increasingly competitive, as established players like netflix are challenged by both capable (e.g. disney+) and more speculative (e.g. walmart’s vudu) newcomers.  to be fair, apple tv+ seems to be slowly transitioning from the latter to the former group.  the counterargument to the bear  i believe that all of the above are fair questions or fears to raise about apple’s service business. but at the same time, the bearish thesis only tells one half of the story. every business has strengths and weaknesses, risks and opportunities. it is unfair to dwell only on one side of the argument.  while there could be a temporary decline in demand for apple’s services, i believe that the secular trends towards streaming audio and video entertainment (apple tv+, apple music), cloud (icloud) and mobile payments (apple card, apple pay) are irreversible. apple’s services segment is on the right side of these trends.  also, apple has vast resources to invest in new offerings, which could help the company to monetize on the expanding installed base of apple devices. the most recent ventures have been arcade and fitness+, but the opportunities have probably not ended there.  lastly, the services segment performed particularly well in the most recent quarter. revenues were up 24% year-over-year, the most since fiscal 2019.  were the thesis about temporary stay-at-home tailwinds accurate, an even more noticeable top-line increase would have happened during the thick of the pandemic, in the june and september 2020 quarters.  twitter speaks  a bearish thesis can be controversial, especially among current shareholders. but being able to analyze the flip side of a bullish argument is an important skill in investing.  i asked twitter if there was merit to goldman sachs’ fears over service revenues and the potential share price decline. here are the responses:  read more from the apple maven:  (disclaimers: this is not investment advice. the author may be long one or more stocks mentioned in this report. also, the article may contain affiliate links. these partnerships do not influence editorial content. thanks for supporting the apple maven)"
2021-04-05 14:27:01,"apple ceo tim cook hinted at the company's work in autonomous vehicles, following recent reports that the company is in renewed talks to develop its own car.  ""the autonomy itself is a core technology, in my view. if you sort of step back, the car, in a lot of ways, is a robot. an autonomous car is a robot. and so there's lots of things you can do with autonomy. and we'll see what apple does,"" cook said in an interview released monday with kara swisher on the ""sway"" podcast.  ""we investigate so many things internally. many of them never see the light of day. i'm not saying that one will not,"" cook added.  when asked if apple was working on a car itself or the technology within a car, cook declined to comment.  ""we love to integrate hardware, software, and services, and find the intersection points of those because we think that's where the magic occurs. and so that's what we love to do. and we love to own the primary technology that's around that,"" he said.  apple has long been expected to get into the auto business with its own vehicle or selling its technology to other car makers, and has made a number of moves indicating it planned to do so. helping bolster its engineering ranks, the company acquired autonomous vehicle startup drive.ai in 2019.  an autonomous vehicle could position the company against tesla, which is rolling out its own self-driving features. in 2018, apple hired back doug field, then tesla's senior vice president of engineering, to presumably work on self-driving cars. apple has also brought in several other former tesla employees, including former tesla vice president of engineering michael schwekutsch, now senior director of engineering for the special projects group at apple.  tesla ceo elon musk had even said last year that he once tried to start talks to sell the company to apple, but cook declined to take a meeting.  ""you know, i've never spoken to elon, although i have great admiration and respect for the company he's built. i think tesla has done an unbelievable job of not only establishing the lead, but keeping the lead for such a long period of time in the ev space. so i have great appreciation for them,"" cook told swisher.  most recently, cnbc reported that apple was close to finalizing a deal with hyundai-kia to manufacture an apple-branded autonomous electric vehicle at the kia assembly plant in west point, georgia. however, the automakers later walked back on the claims.  listen to the full interview with tim cook here.  subscribe to cnbc on youtube."

2021-04-05 08:17:17,"today, we’re going to discuss the most complicated part about options — time value.  i’ve received a few questions from readers about this concept over the past couple of weeks. so, i want to get right to it…  the most important part of time value is the decay in price.  here’s how it works. time value is considered the part of the option’s price that’s based on the time remaining until it expires.  now, time value decays over time — and at a much faster pace as the expiration date gets closer.  to show what i mean, i’m sharing the chart below. i’ve used it several times at the total wealth symposium — our annual exclusive investment conference…  as you can see, the closer we get to expiration (0 days), the more rapidly the time value evaporates.  this is what most beginners don’t understand.  it’s the key factor in determining the premium you pay for any option. but time decay can become your biggest risk, too.  let me explain…  an example of time decay  [editor’s note: this is not a recommendation. it’s only an example to illustrate how time decay works.]  let’s say we buy an august $125 call option on apple (nasdaq: aapl) today and it’s trading for around $8 per contract.  we have about 120 days before the option expires, and we paid $8 for a slightly “out of the money” call option on apple’s stock.  remember, an “out of the money” option would be worth nothing if it were exercised today. its strike price is above where the stock is currently trading. so, the option premium we are paying is considered time value.  let’s assume the stock flutters around this area for the next 90 days. and in the end, the stock is up just about 4% to $127.  since we paid $8 for the $125 calls, our breakeven price would be $133 per share.  with the stock well below that, thanks to the time value decay over the last 90 days, our option would now be down about 40% — even though the stock is up 4% since buying our call option."

2021-04-06 18:33:59,"everythingapplepro  the iphone 13 (or whatever apple calls its 2021 flagship) should be here in about five months, with a mid-september release date that was backed up with new april rumors from industry insiders cited by digitimes, reporting that production for the phones' new chips is ahead of schedule. naturally, the rumor mill is a-churning, and the leaks have already begun their steady drip. the iphone 13 (or will it be the iphone 12s?) lineup is rumored to include four models -- the iphone 13, iphone 13 mini, iphone 13 pro and iphone 13 pro max -- just like the iphone 12 lineup, according to analyst ming-chi kuo. just this week, new rumors emerged about the iphone 13's two pro models sporting a ltpo display, lending credence to the possibility of a 120hz refresh rate.  rumors were circulating about apple's 2021 phone lineup even before the last apple event, which unveiled the iphone 12. and the leaks are only going to ramp up as we get closer to the next iphone release date (in the meantime, there's another apple event rumored to be happening very soon). read on to find the latest rumors about the iphone 13's price, design, specs, camera features and more. we'll update this story as new information becomes available.  read more: iphone 13 vs. iphone 12  now playing: watch this: iphone 13 rumor roundup  release date: iphone 13 should be here by mid-september  so far, there's no official or unofficial word on when we can expect to see apple's next iphone. an april report suggested the manufacturing of the iphones' new chips were running ahead of schedule, putting the iphone 13 release date back on apple's pre-pandemic timeline. usually, we can predict with some degree of accuracy when apple's iphone events will occur and extrapolate a release date based on that.  but 2020 was a different story -- it was the first september apple event in eight years without an iphone -- thanks to delays in production due to the coronavirus pandemic. this year, however, kuo is also forecasting business as usual for apple's supply chain. if that's the case, we can expect to see the iphone 13 unveiled at an event sometime in september.  let's synthesize the info we have:  apple likes to hold its events on tuesdays or wednesdays.  iphone release dates are typically a week and a half after apple's announcements.  in general, new iphones are released on a friday, around the third week of september.  a few years ago, cnet took a deep dive into the apple event timeline and emerged with a compelling labor day hypothesis, which you can read about here. based on the 2021 calendar, the labor day rule would put the september apple event (and unveiling of the iphone 13) on sept. 8, with a sept. 17 release date.  read more: iphone 13 wish list: what apple needs for its next phone to succeed  name: apple's next flagship might not be called iphone 13  we're going with the name ""iphone 13"" for now, but the moniker is not a sure thing. considering high-rise buildings tend to omit the 13th floor from their elevator buttons for superstitious reasons, apple could very well succumb to its own triskaidekaphobia and skip the number 13.  read more: iphone 13 might be the phone that never hits shelves. here's why people think so  iphone 12s is a worthy guess for the name of apple's next generation of iphones. just as 2014's iphone 6 gave way to 2015's iphone 6s and 2017's iphone x preceded 2018's iphone xs, without a major redesign in the works (more on that below), the 2021 iphone is just as likely to be positioned as an improvement on the iphone 12.  or maybe apple will take a page out of samsung's book and name its next phone after the year of its conception: iphone 2021 has a nice ring to it. or what about the iphone xxi? or, dare to dream, apple could go in a completely different direction and name it something fun, like the motorola citrus or lg chocolate of yore.  price: iphone 13 could cost the same as iphone 12… or even less  apple's iphone 12 lineup included four phones at four prices, with even more variation among carriers and storage configurations. at launch, the baseline iphone 12 carrier model cost $799, an increase of $100 from 2019's iphone 11, largely due to the addition of 5g support. because the iphone 13 is not expected to have such a major technical upgrade, analysts are predicting a similar price structure for 2021.  gif by caitlin petrakovitz/cnet  here's the iphone 12's us pricing, for reference:  iphone 12 pricing: all four new models iphone 12 model 64gb 128gb 256gb 512gb iphone 12 mini (carrier model) $699 $749 $849 n/a iphone 12 mini (sim-free from apple) $729 $779 $879 n/a iphone 12 (carrier model) $799 $849 $949 n/a iphone 12 (sim-free from apple) $829 $879 $979 n/a iphone 12 pro n/a $999 $1,099 $1,299 iphone 12 pro max n/a $1,099 $1,199 $1,399  there is some speculation that apple might consider lowering the price of its next phone lineup. several rivals rose to the occasion of the economic downturn by releasing more affordable models in 2020, such as samsung's galaxy s20 fe and google's pixel 5: both are the same price as the iphone 12 mini, but about $100 less than the iphone 12. the newly released samsung galaxy s21 also boasted a lower price tag, starting at $200 lower than its predecessor.  sales of the iphone 12 could indicate the direction apple might take in pricing the iphone 13. the predicted 2020 ""supercycle"" seems to have happened as apple expected: in october, the iphone 12 and 12 pro became the first and second best-selling 5g phone models worldwide. and apple recently announced that the iphone 12 led to the largest revenue and profit in the company's history.  design: iphone 13 will probably look familiar  not a lot of leaked renders or grainy videos have emerged yet, other than a 3d-printed mockup from japanese blog macotakara and some concept renderings from everythingapplepro, but we don't expect any big changes to the iphone's design in 2021, considering 2020 saw a pretty significant ""slabular"" redesign already with the return of the iphone 5's flat sides. apple is also not expected to make any changes to the phone's sizing from the previous generation.  iphone 13's rumored sizes:  iphone 13 mini: 5.4-inch  iphone 13: 6.1-inch  iphone 13 pro: 6.1-inch  iphone 13 pro max: 6.7-inch  two potential design elements that are getting some decent buzz already: a shallower notch, which is also evident in the leaked mockup (or even a completely notchless screen) and the death of the lightning port, both of which have been speculated about, hoped for or dreaded ad nauseam for generations of iphones.  everythingapplepro  iphone 13 may nix the chunky notch -- or just slim it down  apple introduced the world to the notched display in 2017 with the release of the iphone x, and as rivals solved the selfie conundrum with hole-punch and under-display cameras, apple still hasn't, er, taken it down a notch. those who crossed their fingers for a notchless or at least smaller-notched iphone 12 are reassigning their hopes to the iphone 13 now that their 2020 all-screen dreams have failed to come to fruition.  rumors of a smaller notch resurfaced in early march in an investors note from analyst ming-chi kuo. in its leaked dummy mockup, macotakara estimated that the iphone 13's notch could shrink to 26.8mm wide (compared to 34.83mm on the iphone 12), while becoming ever-so slightly taller, at 5.35mm, compared to the iphone 12's 5.3mm notch height.  macotakara  will apple kill the lightning port, too?  when apple ousted the headphone jack, the doomsday clock started ticking for the iphone's charging port as well, according to industry analysts. though a lot of us are still holding out hope for a usb-c port, the introduction of magsafe accessories in 2020 all but sealed the deal on a portless future for the iphone. frequent leaker jon prosser shares this prediction, asserting on his youtube channel, ""the end goal is very obviously portless.""  but don't get too excited (nervous?): kuo predicts that only one 2021 iphone will be completely portless, likely the iphone 13 pro max.  apple  cameras: new photo tricks and tech coming to the iphone 13  the iphone got some pretty well-received camera upgrades in 2020, especially in the pro max model, which introduced the ios crowd to lidar (also found on the pro) and proraw. the iphone 12 even wrested cnet photo enthusiast stephen shankland's loyalty away from google pixel, the erstwhile computational photography king.  read more: iphone 13 camera rumors: the specs and upgrades we'll likely see  everythingapplepro  better zoom capabilities for the iphone 13  one weak spot in the 2020 lineup's camera offerings, however, was zoom technology. the iphone 12 pro max only featured a 2.5x optical zoom -- for comparison, samsung's galaxy s20 ultra and now the s21 ultra both offer a 100x zoom (though it is a mix of optical and digital).  according to etnews (as reported by techradar), the iphone 13 could potentially include a periscope camera, a technology that would allow for a larger zoom range without requiring an even larger camera bump. kuo made similar predictions for a future periscope lens, though his report hinted that we may have to wait until 2022. it's also possible that the 2.5x zoom found on the iphone 12 pro max could trickle down to the next iphone's pro model.  improved night mode photos  new rumors in early february hint at welcome improvements for low-light photography. analysts are predicting an ultrawide-angle lens with a larger aperture -- f1.8, instead of f2.4. a larger aperture means more light can hit the sensor, which makes for better photos at nighttime or in low-light situations.  you get lidar, you get lidar, everyone gets lidar!  all four models of the iphone 13 lineup could include lidar technology, according to a digitimes report. lidar was introduced to the iphone in 2020 but only on the pro and pro max models, so this would only be a true upgrade for the basic model and the mini. still, lidar for everyone would be pretty nifty -- the camera feature, which stands for ""light detection and ranging,"" is a depth sensor that uses lasers to measure distance. the camera trick can take your iphone photos to the next level, and it also has some pretty cool ar applications.  patrick holland/cnet  features: all the other iphone 13 rumors we've heard  there's a lot we can confidently predict for the 2021 iphone lineup based on last year's features and apple's usual track record. for instance, 5g is all but a foregone conclusion. there probably won't be a charger or headphones in the box, nor a headphone jack, nor a usb-c port. and unless 2021 throws us for an even bigger loop than 2020, we expect apple to preview ios 15 at its annual wwdc event in june, shipping the iphone 13 with the new operating system installed.  120hz refresh rate for the iphone 13 pro and pro max  we thought we'd get a refreshed refresh rate in the iphone 12, but the 120hz rumors didn't pan out -- likely because of the already increased demands on battery from the phone's 5g connectivity. instead, apple's lineup last year featured the same 60hz display as the previous year's iphone 11.  but 2021 could be the year of the 120hz display, which would result in a smoother, faster scrolling experience thanks to a higher screen refresh rate. many higher-end competitors already feature a 120hz display (e.g., the oneplus 8t and galaxy s21), so the odds are good apple heads in this direction for its next pro line.  evidence for doubling the refresh rate in 2021 comes from korean news site the elec, which reports that two of the iphone 13 models will use ltpo technology in their screens (story is in spanish). this screen tech would make the phone more power-efficient in general, meaning smaller batteries and/or longer battery life are also probable (not to mention these whispers about an always-on display). learn more about ltpo, or low-temperature polycrystalline oxide, oled screens. this rumor was repeated by well-known leaker max weinbach in mid-february on youtube and reported again in an april digitimes report.  an always-on display  like the apple watch (and android phones), the iphone 13 may have its own version of the always-on display, what weinbach called a ""toned-down lock screen."" if rumors are true, your next iphone would always display the time and battery charge, as well as incoming notifications, without you having to unlock or wake the whole screen.  return of the touch id button  bloomberg reported in 2019 that the beloved touch id button could return as an under-display sensor in the next year's flagship, which would have been the iphone 12. that didn't happen, but the bloomberg report left room for error, saying the technology could ""slip to the 2021 iphone refresh.""  twitter leaker @l0vetodream also teased an under-display touch id last fall, which was subsequently corroborated (and translated) by prosser.  “mesa” is touch id.    “uts” is “under the screen” — jon prosser (@jon_prosser) october 16, 2020  apple's 2020 ipad air, announced last september during what normally would have been an iphone unveiling event, integrated a touch id button onto the side of the device. this addition was exciting because it solved the ""face id doesn't work while wearing a mask"" problem without ceding screen real estate. an under-display button would solve the problem, too, though it remains to be seen whether the tech will be ready in time for the iphone 13. (meanwhile, those who own an apple watch will have yet another option for masked iphone-unlocking, once ios 14.5 becomes available.)  as we near the purported september iphone announcement, we'll keep this post updated with all the iphone 13 leaks, rumors and other speculation as it comes up, so check back.  and in the meantime, here's what you should know about the iphone 12:"

2021-04-06 15:36:14,"which way might apple stock head: up 40% or down 30%? three wall street analysts believe that either outcome is plausible. here are the paths that could propel shares to the moon or send them crashing down.  wall street analysts seem to agree, on average, that apple stock is a strong buy. but around the consensus price target of $150 per share, estimates vary widely: from $83 at the bearish end to $175 at the bullish end of the spectrum.  what might justify apple stock rising nearly 40% to reach the most optimistic of price targets? on the flip side, what are the key risks to apple stock tanking about 30% towards the bottom of the well? these are questions that the apple maven will explore today.  figure1: wall street sign. unsplash  iphone super cycle  the wall street bulls in question are two: wedbush’s dan ives and evercore isi’s amit daryanani. although both see the same upside to investing in apple shares today, the analysts approach the bullish case from different angles.  wedbush places the iphone at the center of the investment thesis. the analyst believes fervently in the 5g super cycle, arguing that just about 40% of apple’s smartphone installed base is currently overdue for an upgrade. greater china, a struggling geographic segment for the past five years, represents a sizable rebounding opportunity.  the research shop offers numbers to support the argument. dan ives sees apple shipping as many as 250 million iphone units in the current year, which is roughly 15% more than consensus. holding all other variables constant, including average prices and margins, i estimate that 2021 iphone sales at these levels could account for up to one-fourth of the stock price upside.  wedbush looks beyond the current year, and sees in the upcoming iphone 13 an important follow up to the “5g party”. demand for the new device should be boosted by product features, including a 1 terabyte storage model, and the buildout of 5g networks across the globe.  apple car, services and wearables opportunities  wedbush’s dan ives shares at least one thing in common with evercore isi’s amit daryanani: a belief that the long-awaited apple car could be a catalyst for further stock price appreciation.  dan offers some figures to explain his bullishness. according to him, the ev (electric vehicle) market could reach $5 trillion over the next decade. should apple announce a production partner by the summer, as wedbush believes will be the case, the cupertino company could begin to capitalize on the opportunity soon.  amit, on the other hand, dives deeper into another couple of high-growth businesses for apple: services and wearables. the analyst sees “a clear path to $100 billion in services revenue by fiscal 2025 and $70 billion for wearables. the growth should help drive margin expansion and help smooth out the cyclical nature of the hardware business”.  should these two segments expand as evercore isi believes they will, both combined would more than double in size in five years, with margin expansion potential. it is not a stretch to see apple stock rising 40% in 12 months if the rest of the market begins to see these growth opportunities the same way.  this ship is going down!  despite plenty of wall street love, apple stock also has its bears. none is more pessimistic about investing in the cupertino company’s shares than goldman sachs’ rod hall, who believes that the stock has over 30% downside risk.  at the core of the analyst’s bearish thesis is the services segment. rod argues that a post-pandemic world could be highly disruptive to service revenues, as consumers choose offscreen entertainment after nearly 18 months of being confined at home.  still within services, goldman believes that apple tv+ could see users flock as the one-year free trial period ends, in july 2021. this would be a blow to a company that is still trying to become a more relevant player in the ultra-competitive streaming video space.  lastly, the analyst believes that the iphone 12 resembles a “redesign cycle” rather than a more meaningful “5g super cycle”. as a result, iphone replacement rates should be low in 2021, and average selling prices could drop as well.  twitter speaks  not long ago, i asked users on twitter if they were concerned about the downside risk in apple stock. now, i turn the question around: what key driver could send shares towards the $175 bullish price target? below are the answers.  read more from the apple maven:  (disclaimers: this is not investment advice. the author may be long one or more stocks mentioned in this report. also, the article may contain affiliate links. these partnerships do not influence editorial content. thanks for supporting the apple maven)"

(aapl) over document requests related to the legal dispute between “fortnite” video game developer epic games inc. and app store, appleinsider reported monday.  what happened: facebook and apple argued about the document request in a joint discovery letter filed with the court on monday, as per the report. facebook is involved in the ongoing dispute because its executive vivek sharma is reportedly set to testify as a witness on behalf of epic.  despite repeated requests from apple for a “limited set of documents” required for cross-examination of sharma, facebook reportedly refused to produce the documents. sharma will testify about the app store, ios app distribution, and facebook's relationship with apple.  facebook is said to have already provided apple with more than 1,600 documents, including about 200 documents involving sharma specifically. however, apple believes there are about 17,000 documents related to sharma that are relevant to the case.  facebook said that producing those documents is an “untimely, unfair, and unjustified request to redo fact discovery,” as per the report.  apple is asking the court to order facebook to comply with its request for the documents. the bench trial is slated to kick off on may 3 and is likely to be held in person, according to the report.  why it matters: last august, apple and alphabet inc. (googl, goog) were taken to court by epic after its fortnite game was removed from the app stores run by the two companies. the removal came after epic tried to bypass a cut charged on in-game purchases by the tech giants. apple has countersued epic.  apple and google have been facing several allegations surrounding their app store policies, including fees for digital purchases. in november last year, apple slashed its app store fee to 15% for small businesses earning up to $1 million per year. the move was replicated by google in march this year."

2021-04-06 01:58:10,"the apple tv 4k hasn’t been updated for more than three and a half years, which is an eternity in technology. but 9to5mac reports that the new tvos 14.5 beta references support for 120hz refresh rates — a capability that no currently available apple tv models have — which could indicate apple is working on a new version of its set-top box.  while it’s not clear what apple may use a 120hz refresh rate for in a new apple tv, one of the more intriguing possibilities is for smoother gaming, like what’s offered with 120hz support on the playstation 5 and xbox series x. apple has been showing increased interest in gaming as of late, so it wouldn’t be too much of a surprise if the new apple tv had more gaming-focused features.  for example, apple just added a bunch of new games to its apple arcade gaming subscription service, which lets you play games on the iphone, ipad, mac, and apple tv and carry your progress across platforms. and the ios 14.5, macos 11.3, and tvos 14.5 betas also all include support for the playstation 5’s dualsense controller and the xbox series x controller — presumably, that support will carry over to the final software releases.  the rumored 120hz support for apple tv would also line up with a bloomberg report from december, which said apple was working on a new apple tv for sometime this year with a “stronger gaming focus.” (that report also said the new set-top box would have a redesigned remote, which will hopefully be easier to use.) while we don’t know exactly when apple will announce this rumored device, or if it will announce it at all, if you’re in the market for a new apple tv, you might want to wait just a bit."
2021-04-07 23:53:08,"after the novel coronavirus tore through communities worldwide and left a path of economic and public health devastation in its wake, many sectors are still struggling to recover. compared to last year, the unemployment rate in the united states has doubled, the long-term unemployment rate has risen, and more than 8 million u.s. residents have slipped under the poverty line since last summer. but despite all of the signs of economic distress on the ground and in our communities, the stock market has been going strong - really strong. in fact, at the same time that many were slipping into poverty, a stock market going gangbusters was creating a new club of hundred billionaires, with elon musk and jeff bezos leading the way.  2020 was, in fact, a year for the record books for musk, who even briefly overtook jeff bezos as the richest man on earth after tesla inc.’s stock market value gained over 700% in a single year and then received an extra boost thanks to the market buzz created by the electric vehicles company’s admittance to the s&p 500. while tesla has had a bit of a volatile ride in recent months, tesla’s stock appears to be back and hotter than ever. and that bubble is likely not anywhere close to bursting as ev markets look forward to a huge boom in the coming months and years.  green energy and ev stocks have already been experiencing record-breaking investment numbers as environment, social, and governance (esg) investing becomes increasingly mainstream. and now evs have gotten a major boost from president joe biden’s massive new infrastructure initiative. $174 billion of the $2 trillion infrastructure and jobs proposal unveiled last week will go directly to supporting electric vehicles. “that money will help pay for 500,000 electric vehicle chargers over the next decade,” vox reported this week. “it also covers modifying factories to build electric vehicles (evs), grants and tax incentives to encourage buyers, and shoring up a domestic supply chain to make electric cars and trucks.”  story continues  related video: hydrogen: from hype to sudden reality    the writing is on the wall: the ev boom coming down the pike is so major that there’s been speculation as to whether the world even produces enough energy to support it. so it makes sense that anyone who’s anyone wants in on the ev game. chinese tech companies including huawei and xiaomi are working on their own battery-powered electric vehicles, and now the latest buzzworthy proposed entry to the ev market came this week from none other than tim cook, who dropped hints about the much-anticipated apple car in a recent episode of kara swisher's sway podcast for the new york times.  it’s been an open secret that apple has been working on an electric car with highly advanced autonomous technology for a while now thanks to patent leaks, but now the apple ceo has finally publicly acknowledged the project. while cook opted not to specify whether apple is working developing its own electric vehicle or the technology within a car, he remarked in the interview that he has great “admiration and respect” for tesla, although he has never personally spoken with elon musk.  what we do know, according to car buzz, is that “after failing to strike a deal with hyundai and nissan to manufacture the car, apple is now reportedly in talks with magna, an auto parts supplier based in canada that is building the fisker ocean.” we also know that the apple car is going to be extremely technologically advanced. in his sway interview, cook compared the upcoming car to a robot, emphasizing the importance of the vehicle’s autonomy technology. ""we love to integrate hardware, software, and services, and find the intersection points of those because we think that's where the magic occurs,"" he said. ""and we love to own the primary technology that's around that.”  while we’re still a little light on the details, it seems clear that apple will not be satisfied to enter the already booming ev market with a car that’s indistinguishable from the rest. when the apple car is finally unveiled, it’s going to be a futuristic vehicle designed to compete in a league of its own.  by haley zaremba for oilprice.com  more top reads from oilprice.com:  read this article on oilprice.com"

""apple's solution would continue to put tile and other apps and hardware developers offering finder services at a competitive disadvantage,"" a house judiciary subcommittee report released last october concluded.  apple has never confirmed that it is working on lost-item tracker hardware. it was not announced in wednesday's press release, nor was tile mentioned. a tile representative didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.  apple's find my technology uses apple devices' bluetooth wireless signals to create a network of devices looking out for lost items. apple said on wednesday that the process is end-to-end encrypted and anonymous, so that neither apple nor the manufacturer of a find my object knows where it is. only the user and their iphone know the location of the product.  apple also said that it would release specifications so that accessory makers could use a new chip in recent iphones using a different kind of wireless signal called ultra wideband to locate lost objects, too.  companies that want to build find my products can participate in apple's authorized accessories program, called mfi. apple said that additional companies will bring find my-compatible products to market."
